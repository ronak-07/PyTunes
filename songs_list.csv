1,Adele,All I Ask,/a/adele/all+i+ask_21105101.html,"[Verse 1]  
I will leave my heart at the door  
I won't say a word  
They've all been said before, you know  
So why don't we just play pretend  
Like we're not scared of what's coming next  
Or scared of having nothing left  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Look, don't get me wrong  
I know there is no tomorrow  
All I ask is  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't need your honesty  
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me  
No one knows me like you do  
And since you're the only one that matters, tell me who do I run to?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Now, don't get me wrong  
I know there is no tomorrow  
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?  
  
[Bridge]  
Let this be our lesson in love  
Let this be the way we remember us  
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious  
And I ain't asking for forgiveness  
All I ask is...  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?

I gave you heaven on a platter baby  
I gave you everything you never gave me

There's too much that I haven't said

I hid it in the seam of your coat

Why were you so cold, let the truth be told  
Tell me was it all for the thrill?

You said I'm crazy,  
If I am I'm crazy for you.  
  
Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here  
Turns me crazy,  
But it's you who makes me lose my head.  
  
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible  
You drift into my head  
And turn me into a crumbling fool.  
  
Tell me to run and I'll race,  
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,  
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,  
And make me crazy for you.  
Crazy for you.  
  
Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.  
I wish you'd come over,  
Send me spinning closer to you.  
  
My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,  
Strips me down bare  
And gets me into my favorite mood.  
  
I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,  
But the more I do,  
The crazier I turn into.  
  
Pacing floors and opening doors,  
Hoping you'll walk through  
And save me boy,  
Because I'm too crazy for you.  
Crazy for you

Sitting on the sea  
Soaking up the sun  
He is a real lover  
And making up the past  
Feeling up his girl  
Like he's never felt a figure before  
  
A jaw dropper  
Looks good when he walks  
Is the subject of their talk  
He would be hard to chase  
But good to catch  
And he could change the world  
With his hands behind his back, oh  
  
You can find him sittin' on your doorstep  
Waiting for a surprise  
And he will feel like he's been there for hours  
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

With eyes that make you melt  
He lends his coat for shelter  
Plus he's there for you  
When he shouldn't be  
But he stays all the same  
Waits for you  
Then sees you through  
  
There's no way I  
Could describe him  
What I'll say is  
Just what I'm hoping for  
  
But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep  
Waiting for a surprise

Hello, can you hear me?  
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be  
When we were younger and free  
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

And a million miles

But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hello, how are you?  
It's so typical of me to talk about myself  
I'm sorry, I hope that you're well  
Did you ever make it out of that town  
Where nothing ever happened?  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
It's no secret  
That the both of us are running out of time

That I give in to my pretendings  
Which forgive you each time  
Without me knowing  
They melt my heart to stone

Each and every time I turn around to leave  
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed  
So desperately I try to link it with my head  
But instead I fall back to my knees  
As you tear your way right through me  
I forgive you once again  
Without me knowing  
You've burnt my heart to stone  
  
And I hear your words that I made up  
You say my name like there could be an us

Whenever I'm standing my own ground  
You build me up, then leave me dead

It is the world to me  
That you are in my life  
But I want to live  
And not just survive

You and I have history,

I heard you've been missing me,  
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be,  
Like when we creep out and she ain't around,  
Haven't you heard the rumors  
  
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds,  
You made a fool out of me,  
And, boy, you're bringing me down,  
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core,

All of these words whispered in my ear,  
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear,  
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it,  
People say crazy things,  
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it,  
Just 'cause you heard it

When it's warm outside  
  
And the look in your eyes  
Is longing to show me the way  
I don't want to wait

Just one kiss from you, and suddenly  
I see the road laid out in front of me  
You give me strength, you give me hope  
And when you hold me in your arms  
You make me whole  
And I don't know just what I would do  
Without one kiss from you

When it feels like it's already here  
We should learn to walk before we run  
But why go anywhere when you're so near  
  
'Cause when I reach out to you  
So sad and confused  
And feeling like I could cry  
You dry my eyes

Our love is gone, but I'll survive  
Hide my tears and dry my eyes  
You don't need to see me cry  
Pack my bags, can't take no more  
Adios, I'm out the door  
Hide your tears and dry your eyes

So dry your tears and rest assured  
Love will find you like before

The ball hits your head, it hits your nose  
It hits your belly, your chin and toes  
Well, try and try and try again  
Keep on trying until the end  
You put your hands out in the air  
You'll catch the ball  
Yes this I swear  
  
Don't give up,  
Keep on going  
You're on a boat,  
So keep on rowing  
Don't give up, don't ever stop  
Try and try and you'll come out on top  
Don't give up  
  
You got yourself rollerskates  
You put them on  
And you feel great  
You stand up  
Then you fall, don't think you can skate at all  
You get back up, then you trip,  
You skip and tip and slip, and flip  
You try and try and try some more  
Soon you're skating across the floor  
  
Don't give up, keep on moving,  
You're gonna get there, just keep on grooving  
Don't give up, don't pack it in  
Try and try, and you'll win  
Don't give up, no no no  
Don't give up, no no no  
Don't give up, no no no  
Don't give up, no no  
Don't give up!

How do I end up in the same old place,  
Faced again with the same mistakes,  
So stubborn thinkin I know what is right,  
But life proves me wrong everytime,  
Takin roads that lead me nowhere,  
How do I expect to get there,  
But when will I learn to just put you first.

I come to you now when I need you,  
But why do I wait to come see you,  
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong cause only with you can I
move on. Can I move on.  
(Oh)  
When I awake it's you that makes  
Me strong,  
And I know that you've been with me all along,  
So many times I begin to close my eyes and listen to my heart,  
With you life is so easy why do I  
Make it hard,  
Oh takin' roads that lead me nowhere how do I expect to get there when will I
Learn to just put you first.

I get out of my own way, let you have your way.  
Cause I realize I'm no god on my own,  
I'm there for you, I'll sell for you  
I can't live without you.

But keep the five, twenties tens and bens completely separate  
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket  
We in recession but let me take a crack at it  
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up  
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks  
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was  
Eating good sleeping soundly  
I know we all have a similar dream  
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet  
And put it in the air and sing  
  
I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad  
Buy all of the things I never had  
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine  
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen  
Oh every time I close my eyes I see my name in shining lights  
A different city every night all right  
I swear the world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire  
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire  
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire  
  
I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad!

265,Bruno Mars,Love,/b/bruno+mars/love_20911213.html,"Now Hollywood wants to make you think they know what love is. But I'm a tell
you what true love is. Love is not what you see in the movies. It's not the
ecstasy it's not what you see in that scene you know what I mean? I'm telling
you right now true love is sacrifice. Love is thinking about others before you
think about yourself love is selfless not selfish. Love is God and God is
love. Love is when you lay down your life for another whether for your brother
your mother your father or your sister it's even laying down your life for
your enemies that's unthinkable but think about that. Love is true. Think.  
  
I'll put you in front of me  
So everybody can see  
My love this is my love  
  
I know that I'll be alright  
As long as you are my guide  
My love this is my love  
  
Love is patient love is kind. It does not envy it does not boast it is not
proud. It is not rude it is not self-seeking it is not easily angered it keeps
no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the
truth. It always protects always trusts always hopes it always perseveres.  
Love never fails. Love is everlasting it's eternal it goes on and on it goes
beyond time love is the only thing that will last when you die but ask the
question why? Do you have love?  
  
I'll put you in front of me  
So everybody can see  
My love this is my love  
  
I know that I'll be alright  
As long as you are my guide  
My love this is my love  
  
There is no greater love than this than he who lays down his life for his
friends. Now are you willing to lay down your life for your friends? You're
probably willing to lay down your life for your mother your father or your
best friends but are you willing to lay down your life for even those that
hate you? I'm going to tell you who did that the definition of love is Jesus
Christ. He is love. The nails in his hands the thorns in his brow hanging on a
cross for your sin my sins that is love he died for you and me while we still
hated him that is love. God is true love and if you don't know this love now
is the time to know perfect love.  
  
I'll put you in front of me  
So everybody can see  
My love this is my love  
  
I know that I'll be alright

And you don't know why

If only a moment, if only a day  
  
A place where you feel safe and warm  
A sanctuary from the storm

Inside a glass of water  
With ripples and the rhymes

Oh that is just the way it was,  
And nothing could be better,  
And nothing ever was.  
And they say you can see your future,  
Inside a glass of water,

She had often begged me for  
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore  
  
Well her heart was filled with gladness  
When she saw those city lights  
She said the prettiest place on earth was  
Baltimore at night  
Well a man feels proud to give his woman  
What she's longing for  
And I kinda liked the streets of Baltimore  
  
Then I got myself a factory job  
I ran an old machine  
And I bought a little cottage  
In a neighborhood serene  
And every night when I'd come home  
With every muscle sore  
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore  
  
Well I did my best to bring her back  
To what she used to be  
Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights  
More than she loved me  
Now I'm a going back on that same train  
That brought me here before  
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore  
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore

I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made  
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed

No more pain bitch you

So you better hear me out this much you owe me  
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed  
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid  
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess  
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet  
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect  
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness  
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left

Jealous when I spend time with the girls  
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know

Go marry someone else and make 'em famous  
And take away there freedom like you did to me

Pushed him into the stinkin' tub  
Cut him up into pieces

And driven  
To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants

Of living  
Have a possible placement

Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement

Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp  
And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth

Cut em, gut 'em 'n just get to stuffin' those girls.  
Man,I think she had enough of those pills,  
So take that thing away to come back later, just to clutch in those steel  
Blades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal,  
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin' told you!  
I keep hearin' voices, like ""Wouldn't ya like to go an get your butcher knife,  
And push it right through her, while ya put your shish-kebab skewers  
Into her barbaquer? Would ya do to her  
What ya usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?""  
""In a world of sin-doer, this is turnin' into a  
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornaments you are.""  
I'll be sure to Gin-sue ya til there's no more skin to ya.  
Boo-ya, who ya think your fuckin' with?  
Duck, because here he comes again.

Holy whack unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're fuckin' right!  
To the rap mobile, let's go!  
  
Marshall! Marshall!  
  
Bitches and Gentleman!  
It's showtime!  
Hurry, hurry, step right up!  
Introducin' the star of our show, his name is  
  
Marshall!  
  
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now  
So without further ado, I bring to you  
  
Marshall!  
  
You 'bout to witness hip hop in its  
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless  
Most hardest, most honest, known artist  
Chip off the old block but old doc is  
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin  
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden  
With his own private plane, his own pilot  
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)  
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes  
Yeah, here I come  
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none  
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Let's get down to business  
I don't got no time to play around what is this?  
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down  
On these clowns, can I get a witness?  
Hell Yeah!  
  
Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles  
Gee willikers Dre, holy bat syllables  
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham  
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals  
So, skip to ya Lou, while I do what I do best  
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it  
Flows too wet, nobody close to it  
Nobody says it was 'til everyone knows the shit  
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated  
On eighties songs  
Exaggerate it all so much  
They make it all up  
There's no such thing  
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans  
It just means so much more to so much more  
People when you rappin' and you know what for  
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all  
To Marshall and Andre's carnival  
Come on! Now  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's just like old times, the dynamic duo  
Two old friends, why panic?  
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes  
Dial straight down the center eight hundred  
You can even call collect, the most feared duet  
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette  
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat  
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set  
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely  
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy  
Jesus, how can shit be so easy  
How can one Chandra be so Levy  
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me  
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V  
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy  
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me  
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains  
Nothin' but clowns down here  
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here  
Yo Dre!  
What up?  
Can I get a hell yeah?  
Hell Yeah!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
So there you have it folks  
Marshall!  
Has come to save the day  
Back with his friend Andre  
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay  
Because  
Marshall!  
And Andre are here to stay and never go away  
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray  
Marshall!  
So until next time friends  
Same blond hair, same rap channel  
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming  
Your host for the evening  
Marshall!  
Oh! Ha!

409,Eminem,Careful What You Wish For,/e/eminem/careful+what+you+wish+for_20793604.html,"So this is it  
This is what I wished for  
Just isn't how I envisioned it  
Fame to the point of imprisonment  
I just thought the shit'd be different  
But something changed  
The minute that I got a whiff of it  
I started to inhale it  
Smell it  
Started sniffin' it  
And it became my cocaine  
I just couldn't quit  
I just wanted a little bit  
Then it turned me to a monster  
I became a hypocrite  
Concert after concert  
  
I was raking in the dough  
Rolling in green  
Had the game hemmed up  
Like a sewing machine  
But I was losing my freedom  
There was no where for me  
To not go and be seen  
And just go and be me  
And there was no in-between  
You either loved it or hate it  
  
Every CD critics gave it a three, then three  
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it  
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest  
The Marshall Mathers was a classic  
The Eminem Show was fantastic  
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it  
I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet  
A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic  
And eight years later, I'm still at it  
Divorce, re-married  
A felon  
A father  
Sleeping pill addict  
And this is real talk  
I feel like the Incredible Hulk  
My back has been broke, and I can still walk  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
'Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just  
Come back on you ten-fold  
  
I said  
  
Be careful what you wish for  
'Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just  
Come back on you ten-fold  
  
I got a letter from a fan, that said  
He's been praying for me  
Every day and for some reason  
It's been weighing on my mind heavy  
'Cause I don't read every  
Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but  
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?  
You didn't pray for me when I was local  
And as I lay these vocals  
I think of all the shit I had to go through  
Just to get to where I'm at  
I've already told you at least  
  
A thousand times in these rhymes  
I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got  
God on my side  
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?  
Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint  
Man, boy's got to look  
Nuts  
And that's the only word I can think of right now  
On how  
To describe the shit  
This is like a vibe you get  
Go ahead and bob to it  
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
'Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just  
Come back on you ten-fold  
  
I said  
  
Be careful what you wish for  
'Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just  
Come back on you ten-fold

Stuffed in the backseat, muzzled n gagged,  
Wrapped in bubble wrap, two lesbians ahh,  
Couple hustler mags, now grab the pez dispenser,  
Fill it up to the max, with muscle relaxers,  
The governor of Alaska, She lusts when I ask her,  
To shove my polaski sausage up in her ass huh,  
While we hover over Nebraska,  
Shooting at the fucking buffalo pasture,  
In the helicopter, man I can't fuck her no faster,  
She's screaming grab my titties, shady suck on those bastards,

And eat the fucking octa Mom's pussy lips with some okra,  
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg, Sizzle with Oprah,  
While bossy pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa,

There you go, yeah, yo yo  
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?  
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against  
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times  
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind  
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'  
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'  
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'  
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evening  
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth  
See they can trigger me but they never figure me out  
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now  
Ain't you mama I'm a make you look so ridiculous now

I said I'm sorry mama  
I never meant to hurt you  
I never meant to make you cry  
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet  
  
I got some skeletons in my closet and  
I don't know if no one knows it  
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it  
I'm a expose it, I'll take you back to '73  
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' C-D  
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months  
My fagot father must have had his panties up in a bunch  
Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye  
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die  
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side  
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I  
Try to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake  
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human  
But I'm man enough to face them today!  
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb  
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun  
Cause I'd a killed them, shit I woulda shot Kim and him both  
This my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Now I would never dis my own mama  
Just to get recognition  
Take a second to listen who you think this record is dissin'  
But put yourself in my position just try to envision  
Witnessin' yo mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen  
Bitchin' that someones always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'  
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's syndrome  
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't  
'Til I grew up, now I blew up  
It makes you sick to your stomach doesn't it?  
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?  
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?  
Well guess what your gettin' older now and  
It's cold when your lonely and Nathan's growin' up so quick  
He's gonna know that your phony  
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her she's beautiful  
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!  
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong  
Bitch, do your song  
Keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom  
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get  
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit  
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?  
Well guess what I am dead, dead to you as can be!

Got to have it,  
Yeah I made it  
I'm addicted

This was a beat with no words at first, it's a blank painting  
Exercising the mind, it's brain strength training  
Starts off something like shady's an insane maniac  
Yeah slim shady that's a zany name aint it  
Now all you needs an image to go with the name, baby  
Wife beaters and white t-shirts  
Hanes mainly, it's a long shot but is it possible  
There's a lane maybe,  
If not, he's gonna have to come and change the whole game aint he  
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it  
He can see his name up in lights  
Women screaming his f-cking name feinting  
Shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium  
Joe Shmoe made it, he took his plain Jane lady  
And his baby Hailey out the trailer  
But he aint trailing anymore he's ahead of the race  
While maintaining his innocence  
Little does he know his train is derailing  
And he's about to be raped by this game anally.

Spilling your guts

But these haters are ice grillin' ya  
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life thye might steal from ya  
Fake friends will kill for ya, die for ya  
But you can't decipher why for the life of ya  
It wasn't like this when you were cyphering  
Argue with your ife again  
She found vicodin in your pants last night again  
Your disputes public  
Nothings private anymore  
When your best friends say bye bye to him  
What kind of apple you take a bite of slim  
(But this is what you wanted Marshall aint it)  
F-ck no, the way that it turned out  
Was nothing like the picture that I painted in my head  
Sometimes a dream I make is more fun than to actually make it  
The game stripped me naked  
It robbed me of ever having another real relation-ship  
With another girl, this World is a f-cking trip  
As I slip in another world  
Proceed, take another hit  
Sniff til I f-cking url  
Tell em all to f-cking sit and spin til they f-cking twirl

Relapsing back in this game, oh well, f-ck it then

With a record of seventeen rapes, four hundred assaults, and four murders,  
The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world  
Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle  
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto  
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe  
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes  
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?  
I noticed there's so many of them  
And there's really not that many of us.  
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust.  
It's on till the break of dawn  
And we're starting this party from dusk  
  
OK, let's go  
  
Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk  
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust  
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus  
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts  
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks  
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed.  
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.  
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.  
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought  
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit  
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce  
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time  
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes  
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.  
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true  
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal  
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.

I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre.  
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me.  
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.  
Cause over and above all, it's just another day  
And this one begins where the last one ends.  
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.  
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz.  
Driving around with a smashed front end  
Let's cash that one in.  
Grab another one from out the stable  
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado  
The hell if I know.  
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?  
Decisions, decisions  
Garage looks like Precision Collision.  
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco  
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

And you pussy's queef all over the rap game, naked  
And use a leaf to clean up the crap stains, feck it  
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later  
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave  
Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em  
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em  
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street  
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep  
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep  
Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep  
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?  
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy  
This is my house, all nine thousand feet  
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth  
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top  
Stand above 'em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop  
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop  
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement, yelling stop!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit  
This must be all that there is, this must be it  
Fuckin'-A even got a bidet  
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper  
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off  
I can just toss a flying saucer in it  
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator  
Living in a house with a fucking elevator

New shit Obie Trice, Eminem  
Get familiar wit it  
  
[Verse 1: Obie Trice]  
Obie the person that came up and deverted  
Cause of nervousness  
That was solely the homie's verdict  
It was worth it  
Cause he changed, became so I observed it  
Certain such of a purpose  
Its like a different version  
So much hurtin' and pain  
Gave him game for certain  
That's why its curtains at his murder if you get him worked up  
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher  
Had enough of  
Isolating myself in a room  
Writing poems for songs doin' the same in school  
Now look what he became a fool  
Cause he learned how to sustain his two  
And obtain fame from you  
Living hard but still Julliard  
A god walks and ain't spent a day in a pew  
Regardless of this I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents  
So welcome to the art department  
  
[Verse 2: Eminem]  
I stimulate the brain mimick  
Emulate the sane  
Sick of people thinkin' its a fuckin' mimick when it ain't  
Clinically insane  
Brain is on Venus  
Suck your anus (Uranus)  
Label me a genius if you ever seen as you would say  
He may seem as though hes plain normal  
If you ever meet him greet him with a shake see he ain't as mean as what they
say  
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say so hes vague  
So they mistake him for just bein' crazed  
You don't think hes strange  
You turn around and tell him please and thanks  
And catch him flippin' you off with his pants down  
Hands around  
His Scrotum tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs

This shit is so motherfuckin' serious

But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight  
  
Farewell miss I know that you can care less  
But I'm sorry for everything I was careless  
But I need you to know that I love you so much  
And I've been drinking myself to sleep my soul's crushed  
A couple more shots I know I'm gonna go nuts  
I can't deal with the fact you left me with no crutch  
I was in love with you how could you do this to me  
Actually I did this to myself, what a tragedy!  
And now what do I do?  
Where do I go?  
Cause everywhere I go I see your face  
It's hard starting over  
Trying to find another shoulder  
To lean on  
I feel like my whole life just got peed on  
They say time heals but dammit I wanna stop time and feel this pain  
As crazy as it sounds to me it's sane  
And I like it, why? 'cause I feel like we're still united  
In some weird way I don't wanna fight it  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight  
  
I wrote you the other day and you didn't write back!  
It's like that!? after all the crap we been through!?  
I can't believe you! I know I fucked up!  
But look within you and find some love and stop being stuck up!  
You keep sending me to voicemail!  
I'm annoyed, hell!, shit you coulda at least sent a text  
But you're probably busy kissing someone else's lips  
While I'm sitting here cleaning my shoes from this shit!  
You're hard headed a sharp headache  
I need help call a medic  
I just cut myself, yeah, I did it  
Without you I'm nothing don't you get it!?  
Every time that I said I loved you I meant it!  
You turn and tell me you hate me and regret that  
We ever met, I can't believe you just said that  
You're so cold you just hit me so low  
I can't take this no more, so hit the road  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight  
  
Some things just don't seem the way they do  
One day you tell me I love you and only you  
I wake up to find out it was a dream  
You're telling me you hate me, you're leaving me  
People change everything changes  
We go from best friends then become strangers  
We go from seeing each other everyday then  
Farewell to never seeing your face again  
  
I can't get you outta of my head  
So I'm out of bed at 4 in the morning  
Wishing I was dead  
But for some odd reason I can't do it  
For some reason I needed to write  
What's on my mind and what's going through it  
Cause if I don't I'll probably suffocate  
Why do you have so much hate  
Towards me you need some loving babe  
God I fucking love you I hate myself  
For falling in love with you  
Just to find out all I did was trouble you  
My heart is aching I'm medicated  
I tried meditating  
But nothing works I don't even feel sedated  
I wish you could feel what I feel for one second  
I reckon you would jump out your window bare naked  
Fuck humiliation, you do anything to get me back  
Opinions wouldn't matter what they thought in fact  
You would tell everyone to fuck themselves good  
And do everything to have me if you could  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight

I mean jesus your rhymes aint even witty  
And every one here knows your lyrics are shitty  
But its ok cuz your tryin your best  
And if you have a girlfriend I'm sure her backs like her chest  
In other words you be fucking a guy  
And don't tell me the excuse, its cuz I was high  
Its cuz your like at the other fags who think their cool  
But infact your really enjoy pushing it stool!

I'm at lost for words cuz my rhymes might be soundin gay

Ill finish your off with a one liner and then I'm done.  
This is the rhyme that with solididfy that I won.

Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it

What are friends?  
Friends are people that you think are your friends  
But they really your enemies, with secret identities  
And disguises, to hide they true colors  
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers  
They want to come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'  
  
What is money?  
Money is what makes a man act funny  
Money is the root of all evil  
Money'll make them same friends come back around  
Swearing that they was always down

Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's

There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward  
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward  
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm  
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm

To settle the score and beat then him mercifully  
For what he first did to me  
It's sure to be the last  
Following footprints with a magnifying glass  
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell

Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs  
Inside the depths of his basement  
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place? went!  
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes

They're only powerful when you got your back turned  
I yearned for the day that we finally met again  
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine  
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean  
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen  
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home  
Beating him over the head with the telephone

I had a dream I was gettin jacked by biters  
It felt like I was bein attacked by spiders  
Developin a fear of biterphobia  
I'm holdin a gas can and lighter over ya  
If I detect ya, I'ma pulverize  
Dissect your brain, diggin in your skull for lies  
And I'ma torture, with material iller  
Than a stark ravin mad serial killer  
I'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is  
A major risk to a plagiarist  
So beware of the aura, A terror for the horrible  
Will scare ya tomorrow, is the airbourne assault of the rappers  
Hit the source to better my skills,  
I head for the border  
And run the Galloping Hills, the choice is yours  
Cause now buddy's noises force me to scream til my voice is hoarse  
Cause I'm sick of these jabber jaws and crap that grab at yours and savage
yours to bite like labradors  
In the range of my double-barrel  
And your life is in danger, trouble, and peril  
  
[Dj scratching]  
  
[Eminem]  
  
I trample and stamp liars, like they were campfires  
Cuz vampires right on my balls and clamp pliers  
And swing on my big thingamajig  
So I'm bringin my nig Proof for backup when I sing at my gig  
Cause biters are fallin head over heels  
In love with every rhyme that I've said over reels  
That's how I became paranoid  
Chewin my fingernails, pullin my hair annoyed  
Cause every time you bit it was deliberate  
So I'm forced to hit a little quicker with  
An ultimatum I assault and slayed em  
With rhymes and it's ultimatum just to cultivate em  
Energetic and imaginative,  
Pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives  
Will reach out and grab ya, 9 times outta 10  
That's why I'm spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen

433,Eminem,Bully,/e/eminem/bully_10106000.html,"Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging  
  
I'm withholding my anger  
Though I'd like to be the strangler  
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck  
It's my right to insist  
That he acknowledge my existence  
But he just displays complete lack of respect  
That's what he says to himself  
As he uses magazines to trash me  
As he sits with both feet up at his desk  
Smokes a bag of his weed  
And starts imagining things  
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed  
And in his jealousy and envy  
It just whirls him in a frenzy  
As he turns on MTV and sees my face  
He don't exist in this world  
So he just twists and he twirls  
Spirals and spins till he runs himself in a rage  
And it's destroying him slowly  
'Cause he does not even know me  
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes  
So he just tortures himself  
He has no fortune and wealth  
So he extorts someone else to get his dough  
And now he's acting like a bully  
So he tries to push and pull me  
But he knows that he can't pull me so he's mad  
He has no choice but to scream  
And raise his voice up at me  
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared  
  
You ain't no motherfucking (bully)  
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)  
I won't allow it, ain't no coward to no (bully)  
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully)  
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)  
  
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...)  
  
Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies  
No more unfortunately  
There's so many motherfuckers that just are  
They just keep pounding at me  
Now that I'm down with 50  
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja' [laughter]  
But his ass is such a puppet  
Irv could shove his whole hand up it  
And just make him say what he wants him to say  
But Suge has Irv's on a string  
And Irv's so nervous that he  
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay  
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough  
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf  
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down  
But our building's made out of bricks  
So you ain't taking out shit  
I know you just did a song with Bobby Brown  
So now you try to pull a race card  
And it backfires in your face hard  
'cause you know we don't play that black and white shit  
Plus this guy that you fucked  
When you was ecstasied up  
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch  
  
You must be taking to much (E...)  
  
Now what bothers me the most  
About hip-hop is we so close  
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac  
We just lost Jam Master J  
Big L got blasted away  
Plus we lost Bugs, Slayed Son, and Freaky Ta  
It's like a never-ending cycle  
That just seems to come full circle  
Everyone's gotta be so fucking hard  
I'm not excluding myself  
'cause I been stupid as well  
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart  
But as we grow as men  
We learn to let shit go, but then again  
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand  
We all got reps to uphold  
When someone steps on our toes  
It's no exception, it goes for every man  
But if Irv really gave a fuck  
About Ja like he claims he does  
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs  
But he just keeps feeding him pills  
So if that E doesn't kill him  
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed  
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight  
If the situation escalates  
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game  
And if I get killed for this rap  
I got a million in cash  
That says I will get you back in Halie's name  
  
Irvine, get your boy off that (E...)  
  
Get at me, dawg

I stand in, by the way as I begin  
Do you know who I am? and may reply with a grin  
Yes, I'm tired of being  
Why should I be secluded, I got a brand new horn to be tooted  
To sum it up in a nutshell, ""Eminem will you kick it for me?""  
So I find myself in a certain?depligatory?  
A place where I dwell in, for some wonderful productions  
To make up for lost time,  
Finally let loose, unloading the stockpile  
A mental projectile, I aim like a reptile  
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this  
""Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?""  
Is there a reason for this? the hatred is aggravating  
How many times will it take you before you realize you're fading?  
Fading from existence, cause simulations are dead  
There's so much more to learn, it pages left to be read,  
So put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor  
While I hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor  
Words can weigh a ton  
Therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one  
  
[Scratched samples] - ""Yeah"", ""It's another...  
  
There are few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side  
But I see no borderline, from under this colorblind  
And some will probably never hold peices of the sacred  
But then I'm finally about to put an end to the hatred  
The world would never endure to arguing  
Awaking to the abscence of unity is startling  
""Oh foolish pride, what the hell is you tryin to do?  
You cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to""  
The outcome we want nothing despicable  
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable  
You're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless and  
You're dull it's time you faced this, here taste this  
Straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles  
The date of my birth on the Earth, the deliverence of a starchild  
Rest with formidable talent and versatility  
  
But with such a power, there comes a responsibilty  
To infridge on the boundaries, so now the defiance is clear  
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear  
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin  
Refuser abusin it's accepted now it's a trend  
  
[Scratched samples] - ""Yeah"", ""It's another...""  
  
You know I don't understand why we all just can't get along  
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for  
No? so then why do you speak for me  
And every other white man when you that we're your enemy?  
  
On the floor lies a broken door, cause I'm not to be spoken for  
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore  
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me  
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry  
But I've? apologies are exhausted  
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted  
So who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted  
Switch to the opposite, now see it being re-enacted  
Pull up the? quick,  
These we hate him, these are past us, huh  
Always fighting for the position of top dog  
That spot's already occupied, and I don't play leapfrog  
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine  
But I'm always having to proove myself, time after time  
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast  
Judged from the past and he's put last  
And bluffing with nothing to say, stutterin and slurrin  
And mutterin words with no meaning, attack me side I'm like Danny Kane  
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin  
And eat it like cheese, pass me the crackers please  
I've got a craving

Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh  
Can't you see what you do to me baby,  
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac  
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick  
You're truly the only one who can do this to me  
You just make me get so crazy  
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic  
One minute I want to slit your throat the next I want to sex  
You make me crazy  
The way we act like two maniacs in the sack  
We fuck like two jack rabbits and maybe that's a bad habit  
'Cause the next day we right back at it  
In the same exact pattern  
What the fuck is the matter with us  
We can't figure out if it's lust  
Or it's love which that is attractin' us to each other  
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother  
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch  
But I stay and still stick it out with you  
Even though I just hit you today but you deserved it  
You hit me first and provoked me to choke you  
Just 'cause I came home late last night  
Crawled in bed and I woke you  
But if there's one thing about you that I admire  
It's baby, because you stay with me  
Maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am  
'Cause when I look at you  
I can see an angel in your eyes but if I look deeper inside  
I see a freakish little side, like a devil in disguise  
You're always full of surprises  
Always pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators and dildos  
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore  
You're only twenty four but you're plenty more mature  
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls  
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy, sexy, cool  
Chill you play your position you never step out of line  
Even though I stay in your business  
You've always kept out of mine  
I wonder what's on your mind  
Sometimes they say love is blind  
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye  
You didn't see the sign  
Or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved  
Maybe cause we're crazy in love  
  
Let me go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh  
You are the ink to my paper  
What my pen is to my my pad  
The moral, the very fiber  
The whole substance to my rap  
You are my reason for being  
The meaning of my existence  
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this  
As intense as I do, and the irony  
Is you rely on me as much  
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do  
You provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire  
You're my entire supply of gas, the match and igniter  
The only way that I'm able to stay so stable  
Is you're the legs to my table,  
If you were to break I'd fall on my face  
But I'm always gonna make you feel  
I don't need you as much as I really need you  
So you don't use it to your advantage  
But you're essential to me  
You're the air I breathe  
I believe if you ever leave me  
I'd probably have no reason to be  
You are the Kim to my Marshall  
You're the Slim to my Shady  
The Dre to my Eminem  
The Alana to my Hailie  
You are the word that I'm lookin for  
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside  
And the right one just won't come to my mind  
You're like the pillar that props me up  
The beam that supports me  
The bitch who never took half  
The wife who never divorced me  
You're like the root to my evil  
You let my devil come out me  
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me  
And no matter how much too much is never enough  
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love  
  
Let me go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go Crazy, crazy on you oh

Deep inside you hold the key  
While the world is fast asleep  
You can take it all if you just dare to dream  
  
Ever since Tony Montana told me that the world is mine  
I started to think positive  
Left the negative behind  
And while the other stars were fast asleep  
I had to rise and shine  
It's funny how I've got a brand new G shock on my wrist  
But I ain't got time to sit and talk about who slept with the most girls  
And who committed the most crime  
One day I had a dream like Martin  
Back when I had a homemade skinframe and a side parting  
They used to make jokes about me  
Now look who's laughing  
I'm sitting at the top of the game  
Love in my heart

And I can blow a hundred fast  
Like Usain Bolt like when he ran for Jamaica  
Me giving up is against the law  
I work hard  
I play more  
I fell in love with my sold out tour  
Sometimes I think some other artists love the after parties more  
Fell victim to the don beat  
So when I'm all counting paper  
Them man are just counting shit  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
I was the boy in the corner  
Made a transition into a champion  
My discovery was televised  
I'm talking anthem after anthem  
Against all odds  
I made it look a walk in the park  
Now it's a brand new day  
And I'll be doin it again

Snatched it off and beat him over the head with a peg  
Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a forty  
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44-D  
Forget an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead  
Wait until it absorbed and fell to the floor dead  
No more said case closed end of discussion  
We blowing up like spontaneous human combustion  
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and dramas  
Cross the bombest  
We blowing up your house  
Killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas  
I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nastradamus  
Cause I ain't making no more threats  
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes  
On Vietnam war vets  
I am more or less sick in the head  
Maybe more  
Because I smoked crack today, yesterday,  
And the day before Sabateur  
Walk the block with a labrador  
Strapped with more straps than El Salvador  
Foul style galore  
Verbal cow manure  
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do,  
I just never had the chance to ever meet You,  
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be,  
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds  
  
Mama had a baby and its head popped off  
(head popped off)  
(head popped off)  
(head popped off)  
(head popped off)

But mama don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off

And by the way where's my dad?!

Predominately, predominately, everything's always predominately  
Predominately-white, predominately-black, well what about me?  
Where does that leave me?  
Well I guess that I'm between predominately both of em'  
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'm a scream  
While I'm projectile vomiting.  
What do I look like a Comedian to you?  
Do you think that I?m kidding?  
What do I look like some kinda idiot?  
Wait a minute shit, don?t answer that  
Why am I so misunderstood?  
Why do I go through so much bullshit  
It's such Bullshit it's tush mull bish  
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again  
Whining about his millions  
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drowning in  
And the dad that he never had,  
And how his childhood was so bad  
And how his mom was a dope addict  
And his ex-wife how they go at it man  
I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers  
Claims he had it, I can't imagine it  
That little rich poor white bastard  
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank  
And take a bath in it  
Man if I only had half of it,  
Shit if you only knew the half of it?

Please release me from these demons I never  
Had any of this shit planned Mom please believe  
I don't wanna be Satans spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry  
Now look at all the pain I caused  
Dear Santa-Clause why are you not coming this year again  
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?  
Everything could have been So perfect but life ain't a fairy tale.  
I'm about to be hoisted up in the air  
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere  
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this Ferris
wheel  
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hallie on the carousel  
Without this crowd everywhere I go but life is like a merry-go-round  
Here we go now do-si-do now curtains up the show must go on now  
Ring-around-the-rosie the show's over you can all go home now  
But the curtain just don't close for me  
This ain't how fame was supposed to be  
Where's the switch I can just turn off-and-on this ain't what I chose to be  
So please God give me the strength  
To have what it takes to carry on  
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

And are you menstruating baby my little friend's waitin' to say hello  
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shakin' like Jell-O  
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
  
Yea  
  
My equilibrium's off, must be the Lithium  
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em  
It just becomes everyday extracurricular  
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun  
A fifth of rum and two bottles of one fifty one  
Fifty one people asleep in my damn livin' room  
'Scuse me hun, but what was your name, Vivian?  
I woke up next to you naked and uh, did we umm?  
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?  
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there doesn't seem to be one  
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm  
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from  
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run  
like Speedy Gonzales to see if I see anyone  
Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiendin' for some  
My head is poundin' to the beat of the drum  
  
Umm  
  
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?  
So I'm hopin' that some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow  
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
  
Oh, Those were the days they certainly were  
It's hurtin' me to know that I'll be closin' the curtain for good  
(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)  
I second that and a third, rush to emergency surgery  
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased  
He no longer gettin' the three hundred bucks for these Perk-idans  
Buster's gettin' to be where he lustfully surged it in  
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurtin' him'  
Childishly on the phone tryin' to rustle up  
Muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of Paxils  
Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumblin' back  
Slipped and fell hit his backbone heard somethin' go crack  
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's bustin' a nap  
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact  
I'm just bustin' my own chops while I'm bustin' a rap  
Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it' I'm back  
  
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?  
So I'm hopin' that some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow  
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
  
So I'm sayin  
Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)  
My name is Shaaady  
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)  
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (So long)

Wrap me in a bolt of lightning  
Send me on my way still smiling  
Maybe that's the way I should go,  
Straight into the mouth of the unknown  
I left the spare key on the table  
Never really thought I'd be able to say  
I merely visit on the weekends  
I lost my whole life and a dear friend  
  
I've said it so many times  
I would change my ways  
No, nevermind

I got a letter from a girl  
Let me read it to you, goes like this  
  
Dear old rab my name is ashlee  
I'm writing to you 'cuz I'm hurt  
When people laughing at me  
  
I get made fun of  
All the time at school  
They call me fat worthless  
School is so cruel  
I hate when lunch time comes  
Coz' I sit alone  
I sit there with tears on my face  
Praying to go home  
But why go home?  
All I do there is cut my wrist  
Parents don't care that I do this shit  
No one loves me it's like  
I'm a piece of trash  
I don't get why god had to make me this fat  
No one would ever care  
If I took my life  
Everynight I get closer to the knife  
And I have to say this all sound about right  
I totally understand if you don't reply  
I just need someone to talk to  
And you seem to be a nice guy  
Believe me or not but your music  
Really helps me  
  
Call me a sinner, call me a saint  
Tell me it's over I'll still love you the same  
Call me your favorite, call me the worst  
Tell me it's over I don't want you to hurt  
It's all that I can say. So, I'll be on my way  
  
Eminem:  
  
First off I just wanna say thanks for writing to me  
Your story grabbed my heart as you can see  
They will stop soon just keep fighting  
Believe it or not we been in the same position  
But no one would help me either  
Either I should of listened  
But I promise we all have a vision  
We are here for a reason don't you forget that  
Pulled what's the matter whatcha become  
And let that face you your way to young  
If we could rebound stay strong  
Whenever your hurt just play this song  
Damn I get so mad  
So who are they to judge?  
There is to much hate  
Where is the frickin love  
Kiss these days just try to deguise it  
But not bring em back  
It's just lost now I wanna find it  
I wanna stop all this bullying shit  
Cuz all it's doing is putting innocent peoples lives at risk  
You wont a girl dead what's the point in all this!  
  
I finally put it all together,  
But nothing really lasts forever  
I had to make a choice that was not mine,  
I had to say goodbye for the last time  
I kept my whole life in suitcase,  
Never really stayed in one place  
Maybe that's the way it should be,  
You know I've led my life like a gypsy  
  
I've said it so many times  
I would change my ways  
No, nevermind  
God knows I've tried  
  
Call me a sinner, call me a saint  
Tell me it's over I'll still love you the same  
Call me your favorite, call me the worst  
Tell me it's over I don't want you to hurt  
It's all that I can say. So, I'll be on my way

Sold a billion tapes and still screamed, ""Fuck the world!""  
(I'm Slim Shady) so come and kill me while my name's hot  
And shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot (Ow!)  
I think I got a generation brainwashed  
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot (uh-oh)  
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot  
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch  
Purple haze and acid raindrops  
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop (gulp gulp)  
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top

You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you

So bring the money by tonight, cause your wife  
Said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life (Help me! Help me!)  
I try to keep it positive and play it cool  
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school (Stay in school!)

I want to grow to be so old that I have to be carried

And leave this crazy world  
  
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl  
It may be early to be planning this stuff

'Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough

My hands have been cuffed  
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff  
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts  
  
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough  
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see  
My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased  
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese

In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts  
With the root of all evil  
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful  
  
And make them do shit illegal  
For these Grant's and Jackson's  
These transactions explain a man's actions  
But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity  
  
Through God and there's a wish he granted me  
He showed me how to cope with the stress  
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed  
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest  
  
To selling dope with the rest  
I quit smoking cess to open my chest  
Life is stressful inside this cesspool  
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel  
  
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics  
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts  
Kids attract static, children with automatics  
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets  
  
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum  
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum  
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth  
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

That's daddy baby

Yesterday I changed your diaper  
Wiped you and powdered you.  
How did you get so big?  
Can't believe it now you're two  
Baby you're so precious  
Daddy's so proud of you  
Sit down bitch  
If you move again I'll beat the shit out of you  
  
(Okay)  
Don't make me wake this baby  
She don't need to see what I'm about to do  
Quit crying bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?  
How could you?  
Just leave me and love him out the blue  
Oh, what's a matter Kim?  
Am I too loud for you?  
Too bad bitch, your gonna finally hear me out this time  
At first, I'm like all right  
You want to throw me out? that's fine!  
But not for him to take my place, are you out you're mind?  
This couch, this T-V, this whole house is mine!  
How could you let him sleep in our bed?  
Look at Kim  
Look at your husband now!  
  
(No!)  
I said look at him!  
He ain't so hot now is he?  
Little punk!

Shut the fuck up!

I don't want to go on  
Living in this world without you  
  
You really fucked me Kim  
You really did a number on me  
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me  
But we was kids then Kim, I was only eighteen  
That was years ago  
I thought we wiped the slate clean  
That's fucked up!  
(I love you!)  
Oh God my brain is racing  
(I love you!)  
What are you doing?  
Change the station I hate this song!  
Does this look like a big joke?  
(No!)  
There's a four year old boy lyin' dead with a slit throat  
In your living room, ha-ha  
What you think I'm kiddin' you?  
You loved him didn't you?  
(No!)  
Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me  
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?  
Fuck you asshole, yeah bite me  
Kim, Kim!  
Why don't you like me?  
You think I'm ugly don't you

No you think I'm ugly

Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me

(I can't I'm scared)  
I said get out bitch!  
(Let go of my hair, please don't do this baby)  
(Please I love you, look we can just take Hallie and leave)  
Fuck you, you did this to us  
You did it, it's your fault  
Oh my God I'm crackin' up  
Get a grip Marshall  
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?  
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie  
That was funny wasn't it?  
(Yes!)  
That was funny wasn't it?  
(Yes!)  
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?  
You and your husband have a fight  
One of you tries to grab a knife  
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adams apple sliced  
(No!)  
And while this is goin' on  
His son just woke up and he just walks in  
She panics and he gets his throat cut  
(Oh my God!)  
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat  
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note  
I should have known better when you started to act weird  
We could've, hey! where you going? get back here!  
You can't run from me Kim  
It's just us, nobody else!  
You're only making this harder on yourself  
Ha! ha! got you!

Ha! go ahead yell!  
Here I'll scream with you!  
Ah somebody help!  
Don't you get it bitch, no one can hear you?

If you had  
One shot,  
Or one opportunity  
To seize everything you ever wanted  
In one moment  
Would you capture it  
Or just let it slip?  
  
Yo  
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy  
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti  
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready  
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'  
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud  
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out  
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now  
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!  
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity  
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked  
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No  
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes  
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke  
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's
when its  
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody  
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment  
You own it, you better never let it go  
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow  
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better  
  
The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping  
This world is mine for the taking  
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order  
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortar  
It only grows harder, only grows hotter  
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him  
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter  
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father  
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter  
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water  
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product  
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada  
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat
goes on  
Da da dumb da dumb da da  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
No more games, I'm a change what you call rage  
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged  
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed  
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage  
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher  
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper  
All the pain inside amplified by the  
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to  
Five and I can't provide the right type of  
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers  
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer,  
This is my life and these times are so hard  
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus  
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna,  
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much  
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not  
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got  
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot  
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not  
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's
lot  
So here I go is my shot.  
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got

We raised our heads towards the sky but there was nothing there to see  
The restless crowd is now breaking the silence  
Anxiety is rising, the sky is turning dark  
A riot is emerging, men beat men to death  
This is unexplainable, a fight without a battle  
The alarm resounds and someone called in a speaker:  
""This is not a drill, I repeat: this is not a drill...""  
  
Today we die, today we testify  
All we do must come to an end - this is the end  
  
Reversed evolving, turning people into beasts  
They're feasting on eachother, strong consume the weak  
Flaming ruins, society is lost  
Shattered city streets filled with blind, nameless creatures  
The sky cracks open, dust is descending  
Breath the black air, feel darkness in your lungs  
Silence - nothing makes a sound  
But we can still hear, the sound of the alarm  
  
Today we die, today we testify  
All we do must come to an end - this is the end  
  
A distant early warning  
A sound from far away  
We raised our heads  
Towards the sky  
Towards the alarm...

I'm still getting chased by those lights  
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on  
And my time is none, because I'm writing more  
I don't hear to meet a soul in this business

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
I can't tell you what it really is  
I can only tell you what it feels like  
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe  
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight  
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight  
High off of love drunk from my hate  
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer  
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown  
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,  
And I love it, wait  
Where you going, I'm leaving you  
No you ain't, come back  
We're running right back, here we go again  
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great  
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane  
But when it's bad, it's awful  
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude  
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her  
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength

You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet  
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,  
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em  
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em  
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,  
Now you're in each others face,  
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em  
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,  
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em  
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both  
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,  
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday  
Yesterday is over, it's a different day  
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her  
Next time you'll show restraint  
You don't get another chance,  
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again  
Now you get to watch her leave,  
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
Now I know we said things, did things  
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns  
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is  
You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded  
Baby please come back, it wasn't you,  
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems  
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano  
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now  
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk  
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,  
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball  
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall  
Next time, there will be no next time  
I apologize even though I know it's lies  
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar  
If she ever tries to fucking leave again  
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Huh?  
Nothing just laying in bed  
Why?  
  
I don't know thinking about something freaky to do  
  
I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine  
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean  
Plus she got a sugar daddy  
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly  
  
If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation  
You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation  
When you step away son, she got her face done  
Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if  
  
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you  
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice  
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency  
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee  
  
Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it  
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it (Maxine!!)  
  
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is  
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit  
You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night  
You say it's gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down  
  
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this  
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be  
You say you want to be with me, but how can you say that  
When you got niggas hiding in your closet  
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely  
  
I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me  
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies  
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas  
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number  
  
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said ""Hey Bitch..  
Haven't I seen you before?"", looked at my nigga  
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands  
And said ""Oh it's like that?""  
  
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit  
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit  
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number  
She asked could I give her mine too  
  
Got to the crib and called her up  
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck  
I said ""Maxine check this out,  
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out""  
  
Got to the crib she let me in  
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom  
I said ""Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things.  
What the fuck are you doing?""  
  
So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing  
As she went for my midsection  
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt  
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work  
  
Before I hit it she said  
""3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass""  
I said ""What is it, another nigga? It's ok""  
She said ""No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS""  
I got up out  
  
Hey, Maxine  
What  
You thinking about sucking my dick?  
Yeah for a small price  
  
For a small price? What you mean?  
You know, money nigga  
You don't need no damn money,  
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.

""All I see is blood and murder, my mind state""  
""Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate""  
""All I see is blood and murder, my mind state""  
Murder murder murder, and kill kill kill!  
  
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand  
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman  
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands  
The shit is in my hands, here's yo' life span  
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than  
You grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland  
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan  
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'  
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin'  
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin'  
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan  
Maybe I need my head inside straightened  
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register  
Dip before somebody catches ya  
Or gets ya description and sketches ya  
Then connects you as the prime suspect  
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet  
'Cause I got a daughter to feed  
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed, the best thing  
Would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King  
And have the lady at the desk bring  
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the Mac  
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack  
This bitch tried escapin' the jack  
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote  
You barely heard a word as she choked  
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked  
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke  
Just then the pigs bust in yellin' ""Freeze!""  
But I'm already wanted for sellin' Ki's  
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees  
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees  
I bust shots, they bust back  
Hit the square in the chest, he wasn't wearin' a vest  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Left the house, pullin' out the drive backin' out  
We were backin' out this lady's Jag started blackin' out  
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face  
Shut ya yakkin' mouth,  
'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp  
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up  
Thinkin' fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up  
Stole her car, made a profit  
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window  
Like the girl on ""Set it Off"" did  
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal  
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool  
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio  
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though  
Parents screamin', ""Son, go in and call the police  
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!""  
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up  
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff  
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before  
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo sixty four  
When they sell out in stores the price triples  
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles  
And collided with an eighty-year old lady with groceries  
There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties  
Stood up and started to see stars  
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars  
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck  
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck  
But I think somebody seen me maybe  
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby  
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits  
Came out with a white flag hollerin' ""truce truce!""  
(Don't shoot!) Surrendered my weapon to cops  
Wasn't me!  
It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnapps

Can you hear that? It's playing our song  
Are you sleepy? Take a nap  
You're not afraid of the dark? Are you?  
  
You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to sleep  
I knock on Dakota's door, its locked so I go to creep  
Round the back, with binoculars, not cause I wanna peep  
But because I'm hungry she smells like tacos I wanna eat  
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are so sweet  
With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall he's on your street  
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet  
Now walk on 'em, he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek  
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, or holiday ham  
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam  
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with Jon Benet Ramsey  
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)  
But I can hear you my love, you keep calling me (My music box)  
And when we're world's apart, you mean the world to me (My music box)  
If you call, I'll come, I will answer (My music box)  
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)  
I hear my music box, playing a song for me (My music box)  
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me (My music box)  
Won't you be my private little dancer (My music box)  
  
I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober gross  
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open I overdose  
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug my nose  
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know  
I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run around  
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds  
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out  
The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out  
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?  
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house  
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box  
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked  
I pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts  
I dig till I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts  
Its playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark  
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's  
Neck like a pixie stick  
The sick Satan worshippin', bitches get horse-whippin's,  
I'm in the back, through the back door, slip in  
Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'  
The mortician of love, sent from above,  
Forced and treat 'em all ? stingy I've become  
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb  
Am I dreamin', is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns  
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder  
I'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her  
Then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her  
With the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her  
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her  
Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha  
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya  
So strong is your fight, but your no match for Dracula  
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her  
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her  
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera  
Stand back, cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step

Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,  
Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama  
Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,  
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza  
How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a
row,  
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,  
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,  
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,  
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate  
And which motel which lake they found her in,  
And how they attacked the victim,  
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,  
Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,  
So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes

Get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light

He can give her some, she can give him some  
Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome  
You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm  
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up  
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a  
Titanium brain that's full of, surprises

You stare into your stereos eyes

To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?

And have pussy lips glued to my face  
With a clit ring in my nose then quit bringin' my flows  
Quit givin' me my ammo. Can't you see why I'm so mean?  
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.

My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise at the same time,  
Can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme  
See what you're seein' is a genius at work, which to me isn't work,  
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first  
'Cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek,  
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue  
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once  
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son  
And walk around the rest of my life spit on,  
And kicked and hit with shit every time  
I sung like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on.  
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl  
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave,  
Screamin' at the sky, 'til clouds gather, it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade  
And that's pretty much the gist of it, the parents are pissed but the kids
love it.  
Nine millimeter heater stashed in two seaters with meat cleavers  
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

You the one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered,  
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side,  
It's green where you water it  
So I know we got issues baby true true true  
But I'd rather work on this with you  
Than to go ahead and start with someone new  
As long as you love me  
  
As you love me we could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke  
As long as you love me  
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold  
As long as you love, love me,  
As long as you love, love me  
  
As long as you love me  
I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold  
Love me,  
As long as you love, love me,  
Please don't go (love me, love me)

I never had the strength to take it higher

And there's just no turnin' back  
When your heart's under attack  
Gonna give everything I have  
It's my destiny  
  
I will never say never (I will fight)

I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower  
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea (oh)

Hold up, aight?  
I can handle him  
  
Now he's bigger than me  
Taller than me  
And he's older than me  
And stronger than me  
And his arms a little bit longer than me  
But he ain't on a J-B song with me  
  
I be trying to chill  
They try to sour the thrill  
No pun intended, was raised by the power of will  
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove  
Like Kobe in the fourth, ice water with blood (lets go)  
  
I gotta be the best, and yes  
We're the fliest  
Like David and Goliath,  
I conquered the giant  
So now I got the world in my hand,  
I was born from two stars  
So the moon is where I land  
(I'm gone)  
  
Yeah  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)

Never the walk miles for love I sit at starters deck  
  
It just happens I was floating you seen it captain?  
Blinked at me then I threw on my thinking cap  
Taker, and then we can slide to Jamaica  
Shopping for a year or two stop in Diego  
  
It's obvious I'm gon sue your mommy is  
We just friends so she can't Clyde Bonnie us  
Fly walls down in the fly halls  
Come to the master suite leave every piece in the master hall  
All about money tied in a know stand over there  
That's why I make it happen on blocks  
Brazil cut sweater, Audi, leather  
Playing the field tryna outslug Berretta

Listen to Wu Tang  
Trying crazy suits on  
Stuntin' in our high top Louie's  
Shorts is the coogies  
Open up the door when you take her to the movies  
  
When you meet the parents you tell De Niro  
Her boyfriend is zero she needs to cut the wierdo  
Next show they gotta up the zeroes  
Nobody rocking like this sixty years old  
  
The hard johns and the Walleys something caught me  
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me  
The young youth rocking the gold tooth  
Pull up in a drop top old school bumping the cash rules  
No question we the reason why the summers blazin'  
You looking good fly color Asian  
Ra I give it yo ya, no trivia  
She used to roll with my G-unit like Olivia  
Till she caught me getting numbers not her's

Guess that's the day she became a runaway love

Searching low and high

Why can't I find, the love of mine,  
When you're standing in front of my face  
Oh why (oh why), You must be mine  
How did I let you get away  
  
Leave it up to the most high sit in a ghost fly  
Chillin' with two of my brothers we both live on deck  
Grabbing em on set  
This is how we roll independence she a go I'm gon go get  
Take that queen assure to ya  
We can live every month baby girl just call me up  
Waking up mess in some cold sweats thinking of this the video tapes  
Even the stress  
  
My mind is a terrible thing to waste  
No love lost I know I'm going crazy I can't floss  
Me my lady left my homies  
It's all baloney just like rocking an old pony  
So when I chillin' I'm just lost no more feeling

Take the time Rae Just and Ye shine

And I ain't with it,  
And I don't wanna be so old and gray,  
Reminiscin' 'bout these better days,  
But convention's telling us to let go,  
So we'll never know

I wish we had another place,  
'Cause everything we did,  
And everything we have is stuck in the moment,  
Yeah  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,

For all the times that you made me feel small  
I fell in love, now I fear nothin' at all  
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable  
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself

Certain people don't like me no more

Leave their cell phones on the table where we see them

Took me out of my car

Therefore G.4's at the Clearport  
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy  
When it came to dope I was quick to export  
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport  
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport  
So many cars D.M.V. though it was mail fraud  
Different traps, I was gettin' mail from  
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne  
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms  
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns  
I shed a tear before the nights over  
God bless the man I put this ice over, uh  
Gettin' 2Pac money twice over  
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller  
I'm makin' love to the angel of death  
Catchin' feelings never stumble retracin' my steps

What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent  
What is you talking, man? That ain't important  
Illuminati, High society  
We in this party and nobody invited me  
We going crazy and I always use my best sense  
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince  
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and  
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and  
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and  
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre  
You just look stupid to be ignoring  
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium  
And parties at Richie is getting risky  
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me  
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed  
Ah, get out my fucking head  
It's just me and my bad bitch  
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt  
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with  
Before I betray them I slit my wrists  
At the top is just us nigga  
Cause I don't really trust niggas  
And we made it through the hurricane  
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane  
We gon' make it, that's on everything  
Truest girls get half naked, every spring  
They saying, ""Hey Kanye  
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,""  
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain  
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break  
On the radio, man I miss myself  
I need to just step back and kiss myself  
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt  
A little lower.. that's what's up  
Somebody pour her another cup  
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?  
I swear until my time is up  
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck  
  
So shine bright tonight you and I  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
Eye to eye so alive  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shining bright like a diamond  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shining bright like a diamond  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
  
Palms rise to the universe  
As we moonshine and molly  
Feel the warmth we'll never die  
We're like diamonds in the sky  
You're a shooting star I see  
A vision of ecstasy  
When you hold me I'm alive  
We're like diamonds in the sky  
  
I knew that we'd become one right away  
Oh right away  
At first sight I felt energy of sun rays  
I saw the life inside your eyes  
  
So shine bright tonight you and I  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
Eye to eye so alive  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

But they will post haste follow me into the after life  
That means you going right after I've  
But I'm the hero sort of like Jack Sparrow  
So some way some how I have survived  
Who is he that we see coming over the tides  
In a speed boat, boat load of pride  
Full of rum, dress shirted and mastermind tie

Popped too many corks to let you dork's offend me

Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I hate with the pressin'  
When I copied hounds it was my best investment  
Dre got shot and it taught me a lesson  
I'm stickin' niggas up and them rubbery masses

Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy  
Fo' different blues, man your outfit is crashin'

Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
  
I met this girl when I was 3 years old  
And what I loved most she had so much soul  
She said ""Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me  
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""  
And from that point I never blow her off  
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off  
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off  
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft  
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown  
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding  
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be  
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave  
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me  
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me  
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me  
She said ""'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!""  
  
I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
Maybe we can start again  
  
But if you really cared for her  
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams  
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her  
It always seems like she talking 'bout me  
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you  
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you  
But they just not you"" and I just got through  
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do: just not new  
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong  
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone  
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home  
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home  
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud  
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud  
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around  
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!  
  
I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
  
Maybe you, do you remember when?

The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus  
So here go my single dog radio needs this  
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus  
That means guns, sex, lies, video tape  
But if I talk about God my record won't get played

There they go again, lyin' to consumers  
Get their hair cut in the little shop of rumors  
Your lil' sloppy with your cockyness ain't ya  
A little arrogant with all your compares  
'Cause as far as the Chi  
I got the most plaques since the beginnin' of rap  
And nah, I ain't mentionin' that  
Y'all just talk about my dough  
How I left Chicago  
How I'm the only one eatin'  
Shut your pie hole  
And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though  
Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro  
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say?  
Only difference between you and me, you were gay  
Ahhhhh, did he get his feelin's hurt?  
Nahhhh, he's got titties under his shirt  
I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
It go my way, Chi-Way  
This way or the highway  
When you walk straight, niggaz tend to look at you sideways  
I say, Fuck that dog, I get my own way  
Niggaz ain't believe me 'till they see me on t.v  
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway  
Then passin' up Freeway, just like it's a relay  
We stay 4 stars, all better  
'Cause the couches in the rooms got, more leather  
And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better  
And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas  
You still dress (Ardjo), but only pay partial  
Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's  
Polo and (Carbesher's), we into them things dogg  
Back in '96 we was livin' like kings dogg  
40 cals or better, tottin' them things dogg  
So up the turkish snake, and take them rings off  
I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -

There must be more good women than men percentage wise  
So her chance of having a husband just minimize  
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys  
And mess with other girls part time to improvise  
I knew she wouldn't vibe  
No I seen her inner eyes  
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs  
She telling me about how black people should enterprise  
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise  
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5  
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive  
Told her I had a girl, nah fuck it I didn't lie  
Told her this rap game is alright. I'm just getting by.  
She had a lil weed and we get a lil high  
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe  
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe  
Boo back in 92' I was just like you  
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels  
I'm like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool  
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school  
And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel  
  
[Chorus](x2)  
We ball til we fall  
Hit the mall  
After we  
Hit don't call  
We fill your lives  
With nothing but lies  
And I would like to  
Apologize  
  
But you can't stand right here  
And tell me everything is going to be alright  
Cause until the day a real man stands up  
I'm going to have to improvise  
  
[Verse 2]  
Was it something I did wrong?  
Yeah I know I'm wrong  
She's at home alone and I'm always gone  
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive  
Now she on the internet looking for classes  
Out of state though, man that hurt yo  
But I got work though, and I'm at work yo  
And she don't call a lot  
And when she do she pouring out her heart  
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm  
And I promised her everything  
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring  
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring  
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges  
Never had money so I feel like a virgin  
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry  
Trying to see can I afford Canaries, with a Ferrari, and a dinner date with
Halle Berry?  
When from 50 g's to fifteen hundred in a week  
Now I'm trying to call..one ring...two rings...seven rings...eight rings  
Her mother picked up the phone  
Like she in school and she don't stay here no more  
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise  
So her chance of having a husband just minimize  
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys  
And focus on school full-time to improvise

No no, you can't stand right here

That's that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
(That's that crack music nigga)  
(That real black music nigga)  
  
How we stop the black panthers?  
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer  
You hear that?  
What Gil Scott was hearing  
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin  
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland  
We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynch  
And we been hanging from the same tree ever since  
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine  
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it  
The fiends cop it  
Nowadays they can't tell if that's that good shit  
We ain't sure man  
Put the CD on your tongue yeah, that's pure man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
From the place where the fathers gone  
The mothers is hardly home  
And the  
Gonna lock us up in a, home  
How the Mexicans say we just trying to party homes  
They want to pack us all in a box like Styrofoam  
Who gave Saddam anthrax?  
George Bush got the answers  
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical  
Am and Hammer baking soda  
Raised they own quota  
Writing when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause  
'Cause dreams of being 'Hova went from being a brokeman to a being a dopeman  
Ta being a president look there's hope man  
This that inspiration for the mos and the folks man  
Shorty come and see if mama straight overdosing  
And this is the soundtrack  
This the type of music you make when you round that  
Crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
  
That's that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
  
God-how could you let this happen, happen, happen, happen, happen, happen?  
  
That's that crack music, crack music  
That real black music, black music  
  
That's that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
  
That's that crack music, crack music,that real black music, black music  
  
Our father, give us this day our daily bread, give us these days and take our
daily bread  
See I done did all this ole bullshit  
And to atone I throw a little something, something on the pulpit  
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit  
And what we gave back was crack music  
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies  
So our mammas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies  
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from Grammy  
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammy's  
This dark dixon has become America's addiction those who ain't even black use

Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Spread your wings, aerial  
  
[Lupe Fiasco]  
Head to the sky, wings raised in  
She's about to fly and take her place in  
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground  
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around  
But aint no going back, this is how it must be  
He told her, she'll be burned alive  
She just told him trust me  
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly  
Knowing she told her you'll leave me if you loved me  
And he knows that, because he knows her  
Hard to hide his feeling's as it engulfs her  
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays  
A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape  
So lets hear it for our heroine, applaud as our spirits fly into the never end  
One closed chapter, it opens up another part  
So this is more like, the end, question mark (question mark, question mark)

I only hold you back  
We on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac  
So fly baby, my baby, so high, sometimes it's so hard to say bye  
We made it from the alley straight up to ballet  
We pulled up to the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet  
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle  
You woulda been the best mom  
I would have been the best 'Ye  
You see it all in my veins, like varicose  
I know that's very gross but we getting very close  
To our end, though I killed most with a pen  
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin

Why can't it be, we go  
What happens when people turn to tears  
Dreams turn to memories  
And weeks turn to years  
Huh? Standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks  
Give me my feelings back, wish it came with a couple reciepts  
Man, our vacation was coming next week  
Girl I swear you was a trip, lets make it a couples retreat (do it)  
How cud my girl do this to me  
Woke up sayin no, the World did this to me  
Now I'm testing one two  
Reportin live from the rubble  
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you  
One, two, three, four, five models on the double  
Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle  
But it's not even half the feeling as hearing you shine  
She know I love ya, shedding tears everyday  
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles  
I ask ""Y"" sometimes like a f-cking vowel  
But hitting tree's everyday like a f-cking owl  
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds  
Caught the Phoenix Sun to Nash it out, I mean ash it out.

I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal  
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal  
This game you could never win  
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again  
Get away from me misery  
Get away from me lonliness  
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness  
Get away from me wack tracks  
I can only make only hits  
I'm an only child lost in the World  
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring  
It's Feeling like hell rings  
Bringing me back down  
Checking my background  
It's ironic what's happening  
Imagine if I didn't have the ends  
I would'nt have so many imaginary friends  
I'm spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk  
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk  
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more  
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore  
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him  
And we ain't finna change, so we'll never agree again  
Till then I'll be pouring out my soul  
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

I'm in the two-door, true that  
Niggas tellin' me ""You back"" (you back)  
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?  
And if life a bitch suck my dick huh?  
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh  
By the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga  
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it  
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you mothafucker and I get it  
No paper hoe, but you can have some more of me  
Or-gy, or are we, speakin' metaphorically  
Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam nigga  
Goin' HAM nigga, me and Jigga  
And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids  
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit  
Had a few white girls, asses flat a shit  
But the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit  
Got 'em jumpin' out the building  
Watch out below, a million out the door  
  
I'm about to go HAM  
Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am  
I'm about to go HAM  
Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am  
  
Fuck y'all mad at me for?  
Y'all don't even know what I've been through  
I play chicken with a Mack truck  
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been moved  
I swam waters with great whites  
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been chewed  
I hustle with vultures late nights  
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been food  
Fuck wrong with these dudes  
Try to walk around in these shoes  
See the shit I saw growing up  
And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's  
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily like  
These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really  
I'm like really half a billi nigga  
Really you got baby money  
Keep it real with niggas  
Niggas ain't got my lady money  
Watch the Throne don't step on our road  
Bad enough we let you step on our globe  
When my nephew died, daddy dead  
Niggas took the price on my uncles head  
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled  
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread  
Bow down, brother pay homage  
Don't spill hate all on my garments  
Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh  
Head shots nigga fuck your vests  
Fuck the pig, no pork on my fork  
Peace God 'cause you know a nigga just went Ham  
  
Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am  
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM  
Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am  
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM

The coldest story ever told  
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless..  
How could you be so heartless?  
Oh, how could you be so heartless?  
  
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo  
Just remember that you talkin' to me though  
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo  
I mean after all the things that we've been through  
I mean after all the things we got into  
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me  
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me  
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me  
So you walk around like you don't know me  
You got a new friend, well I got homies  
But in the end it's still so lonely

How could be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out a side of me that I don't know  
I decided we weren't goin' speak so  
Why we up three A.M. on the phone  
Why does she be so mad at me for  
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold  
I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up  
Cause I already know how this thing go  
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me  
They say that they don't see what you see in me  
You wait a couple months then you gon' see  
You'll never find nobody better than me

Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk  
Baby let's just knock it off  
They don't know what we been through  
They don't know 'bout me and you  
So I got something new to see  
And you just goin' keep hatin' me  
And we just goin' be enemies  
I know you can't believe  
I could just leave it wrong  
And you can't make it right  
I'm goin' take off tonight  
Into the night

Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold  
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul  
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?  
You work late nights just to keep on the lights  
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike  
And you would give anything in this world  
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl  
And you never put no man over me  
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?  
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes  
Cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry  
As we knelt on the kitchen floor  
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more  
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more  
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford  
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable  
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot  
A livin legend too, just look at what heaven do  
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate  
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with  
But still supported me when I did the opposite  
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get  
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you  
You was getting through, can the choir please  
Give me a verse of ""You, Are So Beautiful To Me""  
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry  
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy  
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet  
Now when I say Hey, yall say Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)

Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)

Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out  
To a restaurant, upper echelon  
Imma get you a jag, whatever else you want  
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?  
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right

Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines  
Why he keep giving me hot lines  
I'm a star, how could I not shine  
How many ladies in the house  
How many ladies in the house without a spouse  
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused  
What you about

Trade it all for a husband and some kids

When I become my mama's boyfriends?

I was only five  
Superman pajama's I was super duper fly  
Sitting here like why, he at least supersize  
You know I scrutinise like who this newer guy  
I'm my mama boyfriend I'm her little husband  
I was the man of the house when there wasn't  
Trying to get to know homie just kill the charm  
You ain't interested in me you just tryna f-ck my mum  
We are the voices of our parents bad choices  
The aftermath of divorces  
The kids of bitter split ups  
And baby sitters  
Grand parents that don't know what to do with us  
And the last thing I want to see is mama's new n-gga  
You old Old Spice wearing  
Short chain wearing  
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing  
Church sock wearing  
When you first stop caring about your appearance  
When you get here anyway I already got parents  
Don't try to put me inline I already got crayons  
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance  
Keep your hands of my mama how I need to got clearance  
Yeah I know she look good but you need to stop staring  
I drew a picture of her that would make her proud  
But the door was locked and the tv up so loud  
I scream out ""I ain't going to sleep no time soon,  
And when I do I'm sleeping in my mama room""

If I was old enough I would fight you n-gga  
I wanna run over you in my bike you n-gga  
Don't go to sleep at night you n-gga

If that's what it's all about  
Mama if that's moving up than I

Twenty years later where has the time gone  
Now you see I'm dating having problems of my own  
Now that I'm grown the tables turned around  
I never thought I'd ever raise another n-ggas child  
He don't like his mama's boyfriend  
Just like me don't wanna do the wrong thing  
That's very un Spike Lee but he be like he go round his mama then  
Cause when she here he be quiet  
When she leave he be talking again  
He be wylin again  
Be calm I don't drink the drama  
A sip of Dom Tyler-Perry-on  
You gon marry my mom look  
I don't read palms and I don't read psalms  
And I did take little man to church  
And took little man to school  
Look littl eman kids don't make the rules

Real life, what does it feel like?  
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight  
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight  
To live a real life  
I just want to be a real boy  
They always say Kanye, he keeps it real boy  
Pinocchio story is, I just want to be a real boy  
Pinocchio story is to be a real boy  
  
It's funny Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it  
I tell the truth and I keep runnin  
It's like I'm looking for something out there trying to find something  
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing  
  
What does it feel like to live real life to be real?  
Not some facade on TV that no can really feel  
Do you really have the stamina...  
For everybody that sees you to say 'where's my camera?'  
For everybody that sees you to say 'sign my autograph'  
For everybody that sees you cry and say 'you oughtta laugh'  
You oughtta laugh  
I just want to be a real boy,  
Pinocchio story goes, I just want to be a real boy  
Pinocchio story goes...  
  
And there is no Gepetto to guide me, no one right beside me  
The only one was behind me I can't find her no more,  
I can't find her no more I cant...  
The only one that come out on the tour and stay, stay, stay...  
Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream  
  
And the fame will be got caught  
And the day I moved to LA  
Maybe that was all my fault  
All my fault to be a real boy  
Chasing the American dream,  
Chasing everything we seen  
Up on the TV screen  
And when I- the Benz was left  
And the clothes was left  
And the hoes was left  
You talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the-  
You spent the doughs to death  
And tell me what tf for a real boy  
  
They say Kanye you keep it to real boy  
Perspective and Wise man say, one day you'll find your way  
The wise man say, you'll find your way  
The wise man say, you'll find your way

You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon  
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goldies in  
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic  
He knows, he so, fuckin' gifted  
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts  
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault  
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty  
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts  
Reality is catchin' up with me  
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for its custody  
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me  
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece  
Thinkin', no one man should have all that power  
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours

Holy, powers, Austin, Powers  
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation  
They say ""How was the abomination of Obama's nation?""  
Well that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation  
At the end of day, goddammit I'm killin' this shit  
I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit  
I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick  
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?

Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'

When a lady walks to me says ""hey you know what's sexy?""  
I say ""no, I don't know what it is,

Slowly slowing down my fear,

Suiting up for my crowning battle,  
This test is my own cross to bare,

Never easy to be called,  
Standing on the front line when the bombs start to fall,

I can feel this light that's inside of me,  
Growing fast into a bolt of lightning,  
I know one spark will shock the world,

I need Your strength to handle the pressure,

Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

Never one without the other, we made a pact  
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa

Saw you downtown, singing the blues  
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

Seems like your forever in a getaway  
Momma told me that it would happen to me one day  
Feels like we've been apart for some light years  
Crater in my heart, filled with my tears  
Stars align, I'll be your girl again  
What I'm tryin say, I want you back in my world again  
  
You're the reason I don't change my number  
I want you to know that it's still the same  
And I bet you remember that summer  
When we kicked it everyday  
Don't know how it happened, just happened  
Kinda like we faded away  
And I feel so alienated, don't you feel so alienated  
  
I miss you and I want you back  
I lost your signal, Where you at?  
And I don't know how we lost contact  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
Can't get you outta my system  
Outta my system, Outta my system  
Can't get you outta my system  
Outta my system, Outta my system  
Can't get you outta my system  
Outta my system, Outta my system  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
  
Sitting watching time passing by me  
Voice in my head asking why me?  
I'm here wishing you would stop by my place  
But the only time we talk is on Myspace  
By the way, have you found my replacement?  
She should be the one on this spaceship  
Waking up, reaching for you when you're not there  
You got me in another galaxy, I'm out there  
  
You're the reason I don't change my number  
I want you to know that it's still the same  
Oh boy I know you remember that summer  
When we kicked it everyday

811,Lady Gaga,Footsteps In The Snow,/l/lady+gaga/footsteps+in+the+snow_20970780.html,"Verse 1:  
Years ago we met by chance  
Thinking - we? D start the greatest love of all  
Both of us were in a trance  
Together we have been so strong  
Through the years I felt a change  
Suspecting? We could not keep our love alive  
Soon it all  
Became so strange  
  
Chorus:  
You? Re gone  
But where I don? T know  
Footsteps you left in the snow  
Now I? M alone  
But where should I go  
I feel like I miss you so  
  
Verse 2:  
I shy away from love these days  
  
Because? I need to be alone for now  
We have to go different ways  
Then I may understand my faults  
I? M sure that it will take some time  
Until? I open up my heart again  
It? S so dark  
The sun won? T shine  
  
Chorus:  
You? Re gone  
But where I don? T know  
Footsteps you left in the snow  
Now I? M alone  
But where should I go  
I feel like I miss you so  
I? D like to set off  
And follow your track  
But I know you would never come back  
All that remains  
At the end of the show  
Are footsteps you left in the snow

When he calls to me, I am ready  
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs  
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain  
Even after three times he betrays me  
Ah oh I'll bring him down, bring him down, down  
Ah oh a king with no crown, king with no crown  
  
I'm just a holy fool,  
Oh baby it's so cruel but  
I'm still in love with Judas baby  
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby it's so cruel  
But I'm still in love with Judas baby

I couldn't love a man so purely  
Even darkness forgave his goofy way  
I've learned love is like a brick you can  
Build a house or sink a dead body  
  
Ah oh I'll bring him down, bring him down, down  
Ah oh a king with no crown, king with no crown

Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
  
In the most Biblical sense,  
I am beyond repentance  
Fame hooker, prostitute wench, vomits her mind  
But in the cultural sense  
I just speak in future tense  
Judas kiss me if offenced,  
Or wear an ear condom next time  
  
I wanna love you, but something's pulling me away from you  
Jesus is my virtue and Judas is the demon I cling to I cling to

Don't forget my lipstick I left it in your ashtray  
I like you a lot lot, all we want is hot hot

I'm not loose, I like to party  
Let's get lost in your Ferrari  
Not psychotic or dramatic  
I like boys and that is that  
Love it when you call me legs  
In the morning buy me eggs  
Watch your heart when we're together  
Boys like you love me forever

I always thought it was you,  
You always thought it was me.  
We always thought we were it,  
Seemed like a real perfect fit,  
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free.  
  
I always thought even though,  
We were so young we could grow.  
Up in the end it'd be us,  
We'd take the F or the bus,  
Where Brooklyn Nights set us free.  
  
[Chorus]  
Its not that I don't wanna love you  
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)  
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death  
When we used to be  
Brooklyn Nights happy.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I miss our cheap chandalier  
'Member when dad hung it there?  
And we would watch Rocky IV,  
The one where the Russian scored,  
I loved Brigitte Nielsen's hair.  
  
I'd call you my champion  
Thought we had already won  
And cracked open our last beer,  
Falling asleep in our tears,  
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free.  
  
[Chorus]  
Its not that I don't wanna love you  
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)  
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death  
When we used to be  
Brooklyn Nights happy.  
  
[Bridge]  
I found an old pair of  
Keys in my purse that opened  
The walkup we shared  
How did they get there, jerk?  
I wanna see you there  
I wanna make it work.  
  
I didn't brush my hair  
And my lashes are falling  
Off of seven years  
Of our bad luck dating.  
I want one last night there,  
A Brooklyn Night affair.  
  
[Chorus]  
Its not that I don't wanna love you  
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)  
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death  
When we used to be  
Brooklyn Nights happy.  
  
[Outro]  
Its not that I don't want to love you  
Cause I really tried, and I  
Just wanna hang with the old you  
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu.  
  
Have a drink with your former self  
We both won't act like someone else  
Maybe then we'd both tell the truth  
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu

We were wanted all along  
I was taught to fight, taught to win  
I never thought I could fail  
  
No fight left or so it seems  
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted  
I've changed my face, I've changed my name  
But no one wants you when you lose  
  
Don't give up  
Cause you have fans  
Don't give up  
You're not beaten yet  
Don't give up  
I know you can make it good  
  
Though I saw it all around  
Never thought I could be affected  
Thought that we'd be the last to go  
It is so strange the way things turn  
  
Drove the night toward my home  
The place that I was born, on the lakeside  
As daylight broke, I saw the earth  
The trees had burned down to the ground  
  
Don't give up  
You still have us  
Don't give up  
We don't need much of anything  
Don't give up  
'Cause somewhere there's a place  
Where we belong  
  
Rest your head  
You worry too much  
It's going to be alright  
When times get rough  
You can fall back on us  
Don't give up  
Please don't give up  
  
'Got to walk out of here  
I can't take anymore  
Going to stand on that bridge  
Keep my eyes down below  
Whatever may come  
And whatever may go  
That river's flowing  
That river's flowing  
  
Moved on to another town  
Tried hard to settle down  
For every job, so many men  
So many men no-one needs  
  
Don't give up

Don't give up  
You're not the only one  
Don't give up

There's a place where we belong

To think I'm dynamite

That I don't stand a chance, a chance

Oh m-m-marry m-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry the night  
  
I'm gonna lace up my boots  
Throw on some leather and cruise  
Down the street that I love  
In my fishnet gloves  
I'm a sinner  
  
Then I'll go down to the bar  
But I won't cry anymore  
I hold my whiskey up high  
Kiss the bartender twice  
I'm a loser

To take me from you  
New York is not just a tan  
That you'll never loose  
  
Love is the new  
Denim or black  
Skeleton guns  
Or wedding bells in the attic  
  
Get Ginger ready  
Climb the El Camino front  
Won't poke holes in the seats with my heels  
'Cause that's where we make love  
  
Come on and run  
Turn the car on and run  
  
I'm gonna marry the night  
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road  
I'm gonna marry the night  
Leave nothin' on these streets to explode

Pretty will be the photograph I leave  
Laying down on famous knives so everybody sees  
  
Bleach out all all the dark

Someone I'll know could love and save me from myself  
Maybe I'll just clean the shit of these fancy shoes  
I'll be a princess di and die with you

I wish that I was strong  
I wish that I was wrong  
I wish that I could cope  
But I took pills and left a note  
  
I'm hungry from an anorexic heart  
I've been trying to tell you how I feel  
But was never very smart  
I'm wrapped in silks made for egyptian queens  
I'll do it in the swimming pool  
So everybody sees  
  
Bleach out all the dark

Volumes I know will love and save me from myself

Right after he proposed with a 16-carat stone wrapped in rose gold  
With the paparazzi all swarming around  
In my louis vuiton white buttoned down  
Oh it's not that deep  
So bob your head for another dead blonde  
Who's real prince is in heaven  
She just wants to sleep  
  
The final act of life will be my own hands to do,

Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me  
He has a funny way saying forever too fast  
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp  
For something he don't have  
I get on my knees and beg you

And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man

It sure as hell don't rhyme  
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold

She wants nothing more than a man to please  
Maybe she's in too deep  
Her love for him ain't cheap  
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece

The man's got a gift for getting what he wants  
He's thirsty when he drinks  
Gets on the brink, and throws her off

And I discovered that my castles stand  
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth  
My missionaries hiding in foreign trenches  
  
For some reason I can't explain  
Once you go there was never  
Never an h-h-h-h-honest word  
And that was when I ruled the world  
  
Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh,  
Oh oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh,  
Oh-oh oh, a oh-oh oh  
  
It was the wicked and a wild wind  
Blew down the doors to let me in  
Shattered windows and the sound of drums  
People couldn't believe what I've become  
  
Revolutionaries wait  
For my blonde head on a silver plate  
Just a Gaga on a lonely string  
Oh who would ever want to be queen?  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth  
My missionaries hiding in foreign trenches  
  
For some reason that I can't explain  
I know Yves Saint Laraunt no he won't call my name  
Never an h-h-h-h-honest word  
But that was when I ruled the world  
  
Now I'm doing my very best not to mess up all the words but,  
A strong apology to Coldplay, but I think otherwise it's a good job  
  
Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh,  
Oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh,  
Oh oh-oh oh,  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth  
The Fame won't change us if we don't let it  
  
For some reason I can't explain  
I know Saint Mary won't call my name  
Never an h-honest word  
But that was when I ruled the world, ruled the world,  
Ru-you-u-uled the world.

The plans that we've made

And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman  
Until the other kiddies knock him down

To see us six feet underground

It doesn't matter what those morons say  
Our nation's leaders are a feeble crew  
There's only twenty of them anyway  
What is twenty next to millions who  
Are looking to you?  
  
All you have to do is sit and wait  
Keeping out of everybody's way  
We'll...you'll be handed power on a plate  
When the ones who matter have their say  
And with chaos installed  
You can reluctantly agree to be called

For distance lends enchantment, and that is why  
All exiles are distinguished, more important, they're not dead

I've been unemployed, and I've starved and I've hated it too  
But I found my salvation in Peron, may the nation  
Let him save them as he saved me

A new Argentina, we face the world together  
And no dissent within

There again we could be foolish not to quit while we're ahead  
I can see us many miles away, inactive  
Sipping cocktails on a terrace, taking breakfast in bed  
Sleeping easy, doing nothing, it's attractive

Don't think I don't think like you  
I often get those nightmares too  
They always take some swallowing  
Sometimes it's very difficult to keep momentum  
If it's you that you are following  
Don't close doors, keep an escape clause  
Because we might lose the Big Apple  
  
But would I have done what I did  
If I hadn't thought, if I hadn't known  
We would take the country

Peron has resigned from the army and this we avow  
The descamisados are those he is marching with now  
He supports you, for he loves you  
Understands you, is one of you  
If not, how could he love me?

A new Argentina, the voice of the people  
Cannot be, and must not be denied

How annoying that they have to fight elections for their cause  
The inconvenience, having to get a majority  
If normal methods of persuasion fail to win them applause  
There are other ways of establishing authority

Cannot be, and will not be, and must not be denied.

958,Madonna,More,/m/madonna/more_20086878.html,"Once upon a time I had plenty of nothing,  
Which was fine with me.  
Because I had rhythm, music, love,  
The sun, the stars and the moon above,  
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea.  
That was when the best things in life were free.  
  
Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty,  
Which is fine with me.  
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm,  
But look at what I got to go with 'em.  
""Who could ask for anything more?"", I hear you query.  
Who would ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.  
  
Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore.  
I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!  
  
Count your blessings, one, two, three  
I just hate keeping score.  
Any number is fine with me  
As long as it's more  
As long as it's more!  
  
I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition  
I find counting a bore.  
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.  
[More! More!]  
  
I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before  
Got my guy and my sky of blue,  
Now, however, I own the view.  
More is better than nothing, true  
But nothing's better than more, more, more  
Nothing's better than more.  
  
One is fun, why not two?  
And if you like two, you might as well have four,  
And if you like four, why not a few  
Why not a slew  
[More! More!]  
  
If you've got a little, why not a lot?  
Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.  
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot  
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.  
[More! More!]  
  
Never say when, never stop at plenty,  
If it's gonna rain, let it pour.  
Happy with ten, happier with twenty  
If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?  
  
Or does that sound too greedy?  
That's not greed, no, indeedy  
That's just stocking the store  
Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard.  
[More! More!]  
  
Each possession you possess  
Helps your spirits to soar.  
That's what's soothing about excess  
Never settle for something less.  
Something's better than nothing, yes!  
But nothing's better than more, more more  
[Except all, all, all]  
Except all, all, all  
Except once you have it all [have it all]  
You may find all else above [find all else above]  
That though things are bliss,  
There's one thing you miss, and that's  
More! More!  
More! More! More! More!  
More! More! More!

How that music used to make me smile  
And I knew that if I had one chance  
I could make those people dance  
And maybe they'd be happy for awhile  
  
Did you write the book of love  
And do you have faith in God above  
If the bible tells you so  
Now do you believe in rock n roll  
And can music save your mortal soul  
And can it teach me how to dance real slow  
Well I know that your in love with him  
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym  
You both kicked off your shoes  
And I did Gods rhythm and blues  
I was a lonely teenage brock of luck  
With a great carnation and a pick up truck  
But I knew that I was out of luck  
The day the music died  
I started singing

Drove my Chevy to the levy  
But the levy was dry  
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  
Singing  
This will be the day that I die  
This will be the day that I die  
  
I met a girl who sang the blues  
And I asked her for some happy news  
But she just smiled and turned away  
Well I went down to the sachet store  
Where I heard the music years before  
But the man there said the music wouldn't play  
Well now in the streets the children screamed  
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed  
But not a word was spoken  
The church bells all broken  
And the three men I admire the most,  
The father, son, and the holy ghost  
They caught the last train for the coast  
The day the music died  
I started singing

Drove my Chevy to the levy

Although she's dressed up to the nines  
At sixes and sevens with you

Couldn't stay all my life down at heel  
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun

Running around, trying everything new  
But nothing impressed me at all  
I never expected it to

All through my wild days  
My mad existence  
I kept my promise  
Don't keep your distance  
  
And as for fortune, and as for fame  
I never invited them in  
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired  
  
They are illusions  
They are not the solutions they promised to be  
The answer was here all the time  
I love you and hope you love me

And pull you in line

But she won't always answer the phone

It's best that we both stop fooling ourselves

There is no one, no one at all  
Never has been, and never will be a lover, male or female

Tricks they can try on their partner  
They're hoping their lover will help them or keep them  
Support them, promote them  
Don't blame them, you're the same

I'm amazed, for I'm only an actress [a soldier]  
Nothing to shout about [One of the thousands]  
Only a girl on the air [Defending the country he loves]  
  
(Eva:)  
But when you act, the things you do affect us all

(Eva:)  
Yes, oh yes  
  
(Peron:)  
So am I, what a fortunate coincidence  
Maybe you're my reward for my efforts here tonight  
  
(Eva:)  
It seems crazy but you must believe  
There's nothing calculated, nothing planned  
Please forgive me if I seem naive  
I would never want to force your hand  
But please understand, I'd be good for you  
  
I don't always rush in like this  
Twenty seconds after saying hello  
Telling strangers I'm too good to miss  
If I'm wrong I hope you'll tell me so  
But you really should know, I'd be good for you  
I'd be surprisingly good for you  
  
I won't go on if I'm boring you  
But do you understand my point of view?  
Do you like what you hear, what you see  
And would you be, good for me too?  
  
I'm not talking of a hurried night  
A frantic tumble then a shy goodbye  
Creeping home before it gets too light  
That's not the reason that I caught your eye  
Which has to imply, I'd be good for you  
I'd be surprisingly good for you  
  
(Peron:)  
Please go on, you enthrall me  
I can understand you perfectly  
And I like what I hear, what I see, and knowing me  
I would be good for you too

You know how this is  
  
If I look at the crystal moon  
At the red branch of the slow autumn at my window  
If I touch near the fire the impalpable ash  
Or the wrinkled body of the log  
Everything carries me to you  
As if everything that exists - aromas, light, metals  
Were little boats that sail toward those isles of yours that wait for me  
  
Well, now  
If little by little you stop loving me  
I shall stop loving you  
Little by little  
If suddenly you forget me  
Do not look for me  
For I shall already have forgotten you  
  
If you think it long and mad the wind of banners that passes through my life  
And you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where I have roots  
Remember  
That on that day, at that hour, I shall lift my arms  
And my roots will set off to seek another land  
  
But if each day, each hour, you feel that you are destined for me  
With implacable sweetness  
If each day a flower climbs up to your lips to seek me  
Ahh my love, ahh my own, in me all that fire is repeated  
In me nothing is extinguished or forgotten  
My love feeds on your love, beloved  
And as long as you live, it will be in your arms without leaving mine

Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged good-bye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room

Mourning all day and mourning all night  
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right  
  
Oh what an exit, that's how to go  
When they're ringing your curtain down  
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron  
It's quite a sunset  
And good for the country in a roundabout way  
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today  
  
But who is this Santa Evita?  
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?  
What kind of goddess has lived among us?  
How will we ever get by without her?  
  
She had her moments, she had some style  
The best show in town was the crowd  
Outside the Casa Rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""

We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long

And she's not coming back to you

Since seventeen October 1945  
But the star has gone, the glamour's worn thin  
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in  
  
Instead of government we had a stage  
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage  
Instead of help we were given a crowd  
She didn't say much, but she said it loud  
  
Sing you fools, but you got it wrong  
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long

Does it burn

Afraid to let you go

To search for my smile  
  
You look so nice

It reminds me of us  
But I forget how it goes

And my mind is tired  
I think I'll sit down for a while  
Settle down for a while

You won't talk with me why

With a baby in her hand  
Under an old street light  
Near a garbage can  
Now she puts the kid away,  
And she's gone to get a hit  
She hates her life,

Never get to fall in love,  
Never get to be cool.

Got roads to drive.

Walking home  
Fresh dirt under my fingernails  
And I can smell hot asphalt  
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass  
And I cannot remember  
What life was like through photographs  
Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past  
  
And sometimes it's a sad song  
  
[Chorus]  
But I cannot forget  
Refuse to regret  
So glad I met you and  
Take my breath away  
Make everyday  
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through  
And Mama I've been cryin'  
Cause things ain't how they used to be  
She said, ""The battle's almost won  
And we're only several miles from the sun.""  
  
Moving on down my street  
I see people I won't ever meet  
Think of her, take a breath  
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps  
  
And sometimes it's a sad song  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The rhythm of her conversation  
The perfection of her creation  
The sex she slipped into my coffee  
The way she felt when she first saw me  
Hate to love and love to hate her  
Like a broken record player  
Back and forth and here and gone  
And on and on and on and on

She said goodbye too many times before  
And her heart is breaking in front of me  
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Keep her coming every night  
So hard to keep her satisfied  
Kept playing love like it was just a game  
Pretending to feel the same

Repair your broken wings

Answer right now

You're doin' wrong  
Gonna lock you up  
Before too long  
Your lyin' eyes  
Gonna tell you right  
So listen up  
Don't make a fight  
Your talk is cheap  
You're not a man  
You're throwin' stones  
To hide your hands

I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start

When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool  
  
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me  
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me  
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me  
And he's talking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me

But I can do anything, she's invincible  
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible  
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible  
  
Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do  
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to  
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me  
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream  
  
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me  
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me

1168,Michael Jackson,Little Susie,/m/michael+jackson/little+susie_20092712.html,"Somebody killed little Susie  
The girl with the tune  
Who sings in the daytime at noon  
She was there screaming  
Beating her voice in her doom  
But nobody came to her soon  
  
A fall down the stairs  
Her dress torn  
Oh the blood in her hair  
A mystery so sullen in air  
She lie there so tenderly  
Fashioned so slenderly  
Lift her with care,  
Oh the blood in her hair  
  
Everyone came to see  
The girl that now is dead  
So blind stare the eyes in her head  
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said  
This girl lived in vain  
Her face bear such agony, such strain  
  
But only the man from next door  
Knew Little Susie and how he cried  
As he reached down  
To close Susie's eyes  
She lie there so tenderly  
Fashioned so slenderly  
Lift her with care  
Oh the blood in her hair  
  
It was all for God's sake  
For her singing the tune  
For someone to feel her despair  
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed  
Then to scream out  
And nobody's there  
  
She knew no one cared  
  
Father left home, poor mother died  
Leaving Susie alone  
Grandfather's soul too had flown  
No one to care  
Just to love her  
How much can one bear  
Rejecting the needs in her prayers  
  
Neglection can kill  
Like a knife in your soul  
Oh it will  
Little Susie fought so hard to live  
She lie there so tenderly  
Fashioned so slenderly  
Lift her with care  
So young and so fair

A thousand times and why  
I played the fool for you  
And still you said goodbye

Have to see  
A fool who lives alone

Set you free

Little children laughing

Of disappointments and confusions

I started talking  
She kept on walking  
She disappeared into the crowd

To a circus girl  
Who left my heart in pieces  
Lost my heart  
On The carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who ran away.  
  
I was the clown  
And she was the dancer  
We both knew it wouldn't work  
But we took our chances  
What I can't recall  
Is if there was a girl at all  
Or was it my imagination?  
I still remember  
All of those faces  
And now all I have is memories.

In love for an instant  
To see that the circus came today  
Sometimes I can hear her crying here  
And I can hear her calling me.

The way she moved  
Her hair, her face, her lines

As she stalked the room  
I could feel the aura  
Of her presence  
Every head turned  
Feeling passion and lust  
  
The girl was persuasive  
The girl I could not trust  
The girl was bad  
The girl was dangerous

Walking the line  
Come go with me  
I said I have no time  
And don't you pretend we didn't  
Talk on the phone

She left me standing alone

Take away my money  
Throw away my time  
You can call me honey  
But you're no damn good for me

With the eyes of desire  
I fell trapped into her  
Web of sin  
A touch, a kiss  
A whisper of love  
I was at the point  
Of no return  
  
Deep in the darkness of  
Passion's insanity

Strange inhumanity

You hurt my baby

She touched me  
For the lips of  
A strange woman  
Drop as a honeycomb  
And her mouth was  
Smoother than oil  
But her inner spirit and words  
Were as sharp as  
A two-edged sword  
But I loved it

That's the new word for today  
E-you-P-H-O-are-I-A  
It's very easy to say  
Say Euphoria and you'll feel fine from the start  
You can close your eyes  
And see the world with your heart  
  
Do what you wish, be what you are  
What a victorious thrill  
Wearing a smile, all of the while  
Feeling the world standing still  
Watch rainbows glow rest on a bed of flowers  
Then dial a star  
Anything's in your powers  
  
Euphoria  
Full euphoria  
Knowing no ills, needing no pills  
Singing a rock and roll hymn  
Feeling glorious, full of love  
Fine from the start  
You can close your eyes  
And see the world with your heart  
  
How good to be happy and free  
Living the way that you choose  
Healthily and clean  
Can't understand anyone having the blues  
Euphoria never to feel frustration  
How great to give euphoria invitation  
Euphoria, euphoria  
Long as we love each other

You go through life making fools of others  
Pretending you're giving them love  
But remember sister or brother  
You all have to answer to the one you above  
  
It's beautiful to watch love begin  
But oh so sad when it ends  
As you got through life remember this rule  
Everybody's somebody's fool

Slaughtered in vain across the land  
And how many children must we see

Close your eyes

See the wonder  
In every living thing

Love will take us to a place where  
God can be seen

Cause you smile at the letter that I sent you today  
  
And I can't wait till I see you again  
And we'll both say remember when  
The band played on the 4th of July  
And you held me on your shoulders way up high  
  
You're still there for me  
Where ever there might be  
And if an ocean lies between us  
I'll send the message across the sea  
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright  
I believe that you were listening to my song  
You're with me  
You've been here all along  
You've been here all along  
  
Back then you walked me to school  
Tell me to be careful and to follow the rules  
Fast forward, you taught me to drive  
You gave me the keys and we went for a ride  
  
And I can't wait till I see you again  
And we both say, remember when  
I'm holding on to moments like that  
And I know that they're coming back  
  
You're still there for me  
Where ever there might be  
And if an ocean lies between us  
I'll send the message across the sea  
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright  
I believe that you were listening to my song  
You're with me  
You've been here all along.  
  
Yeahh  
  
All along, the way  
I keep you in my heart  
And in my breath  
You'll always be the one  
That cares the most  
Counting all the days  
I see you runnin' up to say  
I miss you  
I miss you  
  
You're still there for me

All that's left  
Is all these ashes

Never find again

In a dream you appear  
For awhile you were here  
So I keep sleeping  
Just to keep you with me  
  
I draw a map  
Connect the dots  
With all the memories that I got  
What I'm missing  
I'll keep reliving

Just know I love the time we both had  
And I don't ever wanna see you sad  
  
Be happy  
I don't wanna hold you

You love me babe

Will stand arm in arm, just like everyone

Sometimes I'm Lazy, I get bored.  
I get scared, I feel ignored  
I feel happy, I get silly  
I choke on my own words  
I make wishes, I have dreams  
And I still want to believe  
Anything can happen in this world  
For an Ordinary Girl  
Like you, like me  
For an Ordinary Girl  
Like you like me  
  
How are you?  
Hello, goodbye  
One day here, one day there  
And again it's time to go  
Miss popular always on the road  
Put my best foot forward  
Gotta get on with the show  
Strike a pose for the front cover of a magazine  
Everywhere I arrive I get high fives  
They pay me larger than life  
  
I'm just an ordinary Girl  
Sometimes I'm Lazy, I get bored.  
I get scared, I feel ignored  
I feel happy, I get silly.  
I choke on my own words  
I make wishes, I have dreams  
And I still want to believe  
Anything can happen in this world  
For an Ordinary Girl  
So give it everything or nothing at all  
And get back on your feet  
When you stumble and fall  
A lil luck can go a long way  
So don't you worry about what people say  
Who knows where the wind may blow  
  
For an ordinary girl... mmm  
  
I'm just an ordinary Girl  
Sometimes I'm Lazy, I get bored.

Welcome to the land of fame excess,  
Whoa, am I gonna fit in?  
  
Jumped in the cab,  
Here I am for the first time  
Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign  
This is all so crazy  
Everybody seems so famous  
  
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick  
Too much pressure and I'm nervous,  
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio  
And the Jay Z song was on  
And the Jay Z song was on  
And the Jay Z song was on

So I put my hands up  
They're playing my song,  
And the butterflies fly away  
Noddin' my head like, yeah  
Movin' my hips like, yeah  
I got my hands up,  
They're playin' my song  
You know I'm gonna be okay  
Yeah, it's a party in the USA  
Yeah it's a party in the USA  
  
Get to the club in a taxi cab  
Everybody's looking at me now  
Like ""who's that chick, that's rockin' kicks?  
She's gotta be from out of town""  
  
So hard with my girls not around me  
Its definitely not a Nashville party  
Cause' all I see are stilettos  
I guess I never got the memo  
  
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick  
Too much pressure and I'm nervous  
That's when the D.J. dropped my favorite tune  
And a Britney song was on  
And a Britney song was on  
And a Britney song was on

Feel like hoppin' on a flight (on a flight)  
Back to my hometown tonight (town tonight)

You're vain, your games, you're insecure  
You love me, you like her  
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy  
Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts  
I wanna be with the one I know  
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do  
You make me love you  
  
It's awkward and it's silent  
As I wait for you to say  
But what I need to hear now your sincere apology  
When you mean it, I'll believe it If you text it I'll delete it  
Let's be clear  
Oh, I'm not coming back  
You're taking seven steps here  
  
The seven things I hate about you  
You're vain, your games, you're insecure  
You love me, you like her  
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy  
Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts  
I wanna be with the one I know  
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do  
You make me love you  
  
Compared to all the great things  
That would take too long to write  
I probably should mention  
The seven that I like  
  
The seven things I like about you  
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's  
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized  
You made me laugh, you made me cry, but I guess that's both that I'll have to
buy  
Your hand in mine when we're intertwined, everything's alright  
I wanna be with the one I know  
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do  
You make me love you  
  
Sha, sha, you do, oh

You release me like a tiger that's been locked in a cage

Alright, so this is really fucked up, but  
Alright, I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude  
And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did just made me cringe
and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall back right out again  
This whole time, I could give to you and I could paint you pictures but I
guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of
love with him in the first place  
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strong
that, I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what is meant to
be  
And you know that, they say that you gotta think what you want into existence,
but you know, I haven't been too good at making decisions so, I have no idea
what the fuck I want, I guess

Laying in my bed just thinking  
Not really feeling like the one I want  
Takes everything in me not to call him

Fuck me so you stop baby talking

and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue
down my fucking throat  
I mean, even in front of your mom  
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough  
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass
bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch  
You know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA, I probably hate it more than your
fucking friends do  
You know, it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead
but, you know I just, I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo

We're laying in my bed just talking  
And now I, now I can't hold it back

Alright, so, I'm gonna be honest  
It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here  
I mean, I'm fucking what?  
Look, I like when you send me, you know, the, the queen emoji, but when I send
back the monkey, you know, the ones with the, the hands over the eyes? That
means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me  
I mean, I don't wanna say it person, I just bury my head in your armpit
which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth  
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do  
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute...  
Well, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world  
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to
someone giving a fuck  
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit  
I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter
what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo

Clear to me now  
I got a whole new perspective  
It's so clear to me now  
You can't treat me that way  
It appears to me  
How long you tried to make me think  
It was me who was being the fake  
So clear  
Why did I smile when I hurt inside?  
Said I was okay when I knew it's a lie  
I wanted to believe in you  
You took your chances and one was me  
So I'll just forgive you and set you free  
I'm on my way  
Yeah I'm stepping out of the haze  
And it's so clear to me now  
I got a whole new perspective  
It's so clear to me now  
You can't treat me that way  
It appears to me  
How long you tried to make me think  
It was me who was being the fake  
So clear  
I wanna put the past behind  
Try and maybe I can find better days  
The first time in a while  
Think I even feel a smile on my face  
I got a whole new perspective  
You can't treat me that way  
It's so clear to me now

It's so clear to me now

In the dead of the night  
Although we both lie close together  
We feel miles apart inside  
  
Was it something I said or something I did  
Did my words not come out right  
Though I tried not to hurt you  
Though I tried  
But I guess that's why they say  
  
[Chorus]  
Every rose has it's thorn  
Just like every night has it's dawn  
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song  
Every rose has it's thorn  
Yeah it does  
  
I listen to our favorite song  
Playing on the radio  
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and easy go  
But I wonder does he know  
Has he ever felt like this  
And I know that you'd be here right now  
If I could let you know somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Though it's been a while now  
I can still feel so much pain  
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals  
But the scar, that scar will remain  
  
Every rose, every rose  
Every rose, has its thorn  
  
I know I could saved a love that night  
If I'd known what to say  
Instead of makin' love  
We both made our separate ways  
  
And now I hear you found somebody new  
And that I never meant that much to you  
And to hear that tears me up inside  
And to see you cuts me like a knife

The light of the true  
The light of silence  
The light of all I do

The more evil hides in its hole

Say anythings to me,  
Anything to get you on my head.  
Don't know how I really feel,  
Cause it's the faith  
That makes it like that I don't care  
Don't know how much it hurts

Like somehow you could be replaced  
And I could walk away  
From the promises we made  
And swore we'd never break

And on and on

Would come back for me

Started questioning us, are we really in love  
Trying to figure out chapter three  
But you're not giving me anything  
If this is what we are, then I gotta move on  
You think this is everything  
But this is no book of us

That I'm lost and foolish  
Leaving you behind

Here comes the part of you and me  
Arguing about nothing  
You told me it's as good as it gets  
Yeah I'm real emotional  
Blame it on your mental jokes  
How much did you think that I could take  
So much for taking this too far  
You can't blame me for who I am  
It's too late for us to try to be in love right now  
  
You might think I'm crazy (crazy)

Moving on up and forward onto all that will become

Fa lalalala  
  
[Verse 1]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
I've had it stuck in my head all day long  
I wrote it in the car on my ride home  
Cause I knew I'd walk in the door and I'd be alone  
Why'd I even put up that fuckin' tree?  
If there's no one here that's gonna see  
Just how pretty she looks on Christmas Eve  
Cause there's no one here next to me  
  
[Chorus 1]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I light another bong  
I turn on the radio  
I binge watch our favorite shows  
This year feels kind of lame  
But the last one was the same  
But the holiday spirit they say  
Is taking off on a plane  
This is my sad Christmas song  
Fa lalalala  
  
[Verse 2]  
I always thought that Santa was kind of cute  
There's something about his beard, big belly, and boots  
I left Santa more than cookies this year  
I thought he might appreciate a few beers  
That's why I'm always on the naughty list  
He said cause when I get drunk, I'm always showing my tits  
He leaned in for a kiss and he got real near  
I had to stop Santa and say ""My true love ain't here""  
  
[Chorus 2]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I rip another bong  
I never been good at making plans  
Next year, I'm gonna be with my man  
My little sister says I'm the Grinch  
But my mom thinks I'm just a bitch  
Why did you have to go?  
We were under the mistletoe  
This is my sad Christmas song

Together we can make it blow  
Right through the roof  
The music's gonna start a revolution  
Too late to play it safe

Let our voice come out from under  
Hear it rise

Party now, party now

For those of you who think that's very crude...  
I'm sorry that I'm not perfect!  
  
I never stole a necklace or got a dui,  
I never cheated on my wife like that golfer guy,  
So what, you can see a little boob from the side...  
I'm sorry that I'm not perfect!  
  
And sure, I danced on a pole,  
And people called it sinning,  
But at least I didn't date a porn star,  
And tell everyone 'I'm winning'!

Girl - She never made a dirty tape and passed it along,  
Guy - She didn't text a photo of her dong,

If I had to leave you now

It doesn't matter anyhow  
You can take your things  
And go your own way

Are just two more lonely people

If love don't change your mind  
Then there's two more lonely people tonight  
  
I don't want the pictures  
I don't want your sympathy  
We don't have to be friends  
We don't have to be enemies  
  
In my head I break it down  
And I'm absolutely sure  
That you and I could work it out  
Or we could kill the lights  
On what we had before

We'll be two more lonely people

We keep goin', we go, we go, we go  
We wake back up and do it all again  
We know, we know, say ""fuck the world"", we ridin' til the end  
I know its sudden, look at what we've become  
I just want you to know that I did it all for you  
  
[Verse 3]  
Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business  
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas  
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me  
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness  
I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact  
I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that  
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective  
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected  
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""  
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen, any minute  
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them  
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him  
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him  
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him  
Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint  
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint

All things go, all things go

I try to channel you in hopes that I could stare you back  
But its like every intersection we just missed each otha'  
You got your fans waitin' tell me you ain't six feet unda'  
And tell me that you coming back that you just took a break  
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake  
In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge  
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge  
Your earrings bamboo, your long nails too  
Your B.M.W. every time you came through  
You was the braveheart  
You stole Wayne heart  
You never switched it up  
You played the same part  
But I needed to grow  
And I needed to know  
That there were some things inside of me that I need to show  
So I just deaded you  
Left you in all black  
But dear old Nicki  
Please call back  
  
You told me you'd come when I needed you  
And you said it so sweetly I believed you  
But I'm standing here calling I cant see you  
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that  
  
Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamor  
Money, fame and power  
'Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour  
I shoulda kept you with me gettin' at them nameless cowards  
There was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess  
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood  
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good  
But you was underground, and I was mainstream  
I live the life now, that we would daydream  
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me  
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me  
The money came yea, tripled and quadrupled it  
But I still miss us when we was on some stupid shit  
But its still fuck the media  
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya  
They just deaded you  
Left you in all black  
But dear old Nicki  
Please call back  
  
You told me you'd come when I needed you

But I'm standing here calling I cant see you

Oh yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you  
And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you

Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away  
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me  
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away  
Angel away, yeah strange in a way  
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away  
They got their guns out aiming at me  
But I become Neo when they aiming at me  
Me, me, me against them  
Me against enemies, me against friends  
Somehow they both seem to become one  
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood  
They start coming and I start rising  
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising  
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more fire

Uh yo, yo  
Everybody wanna try to box me in  
Suffocating every time it locks me in  
Paintin' they own pictures than they crop me in  
But I will remain where the top begins  
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line  
I am not a girl that can ever be defined  
I am not fly, I am levitation  
I represent an entire generation  
I hear the criticism loud and clear  
That is how I know that the time is near  
So we become alive in a time of fear  
And I ain't got no motherfucking time to spare  
Cry my eyes out for days upon days  
Such a heavy burden placed upon me  
But when you go hard your nay's become yay's  
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's

You let me ride  
You let me rock  
You let me slide  
And when they lookin'  
You let me hide.  
Defend my honor  
Protect my pride.  
The good advice  
I always hated  
But looking back  
It made me greater.  
You always told me  
Forget the haters  
Just get my money,  
Just get my weight up.  
Know when I'm lying,  
Know when I'm crying  
It's like you got it  
Down to a science  
Why am I trying  
No you ain't buying,  
I tried to fight it  
Back with defiance.  
You make me laugh  
You make me hoarse  
From yelling at you  
And getting at you  
Picking up dishes  
Throwing them at you.  
Why are you speaking  
When no one asked you.

And you start leaving  
And I start crying  
And I start screaming

But whats the reason.  
Always get the reaction you wanted  
I'm actually fronting  
I'm askin' you something  
Yo, answer this question,  
Class is in session,  
Tired of letting  
Passive aggression  
Control my mind,  
Capture my soul  
OK your right  
Just let it go.  
OK you got it,  
Its in the can.  
Before I played it  
You knew my hand.  
You could turn a free throw into a goal.  
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul.

Stop,  
Stop,  
Would you just stop looking through me

I'm visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby  
Jump on this Harley  
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley  
Sip some Bacardi  
Then go pull up at the afterparty  
I think we make a perfect couple  
But you think I'm trouble  
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number  
She got me feeling like ""maybe she the wrong woman""  
Think I'm'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'  
Your toes painted hair fixed all the time  
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine  
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you  
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do  
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long  
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong  
Before I head home  
I'm'a stop at your house and blow the horn  
If you come outside you know it's on (holla at your boy)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Lloyd Banks]  
Bitches be frustrated with the baller  
Wonder why I don't call her  
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her  
It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her  
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more  
She loves it when I'm in town  
Hate it when I'm not around  
I get her and wear down  
Next door neighbors hear the sound  
Pictures hittin' the ground  
Just enough to hold us down  
I'm stickin' n' moving cruising after the third round  
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy  
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady  
I admit I fell in love with her frame  
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name  
Her panties wet over fame  
Fall in love with my chain  
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain  
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only  
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[50 Cent]  
(Yeah) What would fuck me up more  
Watching her lick her lips  
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man  
I sweet talking her if she like  
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right  
Look I'm legit now used to break laws  
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours  
Big house big Benz girl it yours  
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws  
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you  
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal  
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you  
Cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you  
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me  
Put my tounge on you you put your tounge on me  
Let me ride on you and you can ride on  
We can do it all the night  
We can have a balla tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I wanna get to know you  
I wanna get to know you, baby  
One dose of my lovin'  
I'm simply gonna drive you, crazy  
  
I wanna be your lover  
I wanna get to know you, lady  
One dose of my lovin'  
I'm really gonna drive you, crazy

I wanna be your lover

Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend, you will be mine  
And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies  
  
[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]  
You could never make eye contact  
Everything you got was based off of my contacts  
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat  
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap  
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it  
You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil' in it  
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it  
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it  
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'  
Cause I was doing it for us, I told em fuck the public  
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating  
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans  
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone  
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn  
But there was something that I should've asked all along  
I'mma ask on the song  
  
[Hook: Skylar]  
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes

And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies  
  
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]  
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes  
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies  
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace  
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate  
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend  
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend  
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em  
If you had a heart, I was hoping you would've showed it some  
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me  
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me  
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony  
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy  
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone  
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn  
But there was something that I should've asked all along  
I'mma ask on the song  
  
[Bridge: Skylar]  
So does she know I've been in that bed before  
A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth  
If I was just another girl  
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you  
There's one thing I need to know  
So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself  
  
[Outro: Skylar]  
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend, you will be mine  
And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies

Stacking up mi chips  
Lining up all mi cups  
Still they all came tumbling down  
  
Man I think I might, think I might make her the one  
Take them stealing me up on the run  
She hits me like a shot gun, I'm done  
If love is the beat, she's the stead of my drum  
Fly me away, the kingdom come  
She got me going daram-dam-daram-dam  
  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till love shot me down  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till you came around  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love

Oh you everything for holding me down  
I'm telling all my homies that mi find mi a queen  
In the jungle so you facing the crowd

Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters  
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures  
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches  
And in a nic of time it just dawned on me  
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me  
But hey, maybe I'll never win  
Maybe I'm settlin'  
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroin  
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn (I'm so Marilyn)  
Write it down, take a picture, bitches e-mail that  
I came to save a thing called female rap  
But I hope my ninja powers  
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards  
You mad at me 'cus you think I got it easy  
If we was in the second grade then you would tease me

See Nicki, follow the rules  
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school

Dear God, I am only what you made me  
And I appreciate everything that you gave me  
But like, I don't wanna do it no more  
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for  
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game  
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name  
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried  
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye  
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him  
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted

Here we go again, it's the game we love  
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs  
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs  
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged  
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs  
We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves  
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs  
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs  
  
[Bridge 1: Nicki Minaj]  
Are you alone? Do you need someone?  
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?  
Thousand words don't change a thing  
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Ware]  
Where did you go? Couldn't see  
I was too busy  
Could've just said no  
Where would you go? I think that I know  
  
[Chorus: Jessie Ware]  
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o

We're back to playing, the crying game

I could've given everything  
Don't wanna let the tears begin  
(We're back to playing, the crying game)  
  
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]  
Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul  
Where it ain't no Easy Pass, you got to use the toll  
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control  
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes  
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious  
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?  
Another slap to the face, another uppercut  
I'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya  
Not cause I wanna, get someone to imitate ya  
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya  
But is you stayin' or goin'?  
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it  
How come you never show it?  
All this love you speak of  
All I want is to love and be loved (To love and be loved)  
  
[Bridge 2: Nicki Minaj]  
I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win  
And I'm coming undone, cause the tears don't end  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Ware]  
Where did you go? Couldn't see  
I was too busy  
Could've just said no  
Where would you go? I think that I know

You be up on the block, posted up in the drop  
And everybody get up in whether you like it or not  
But how them girls blow up but don't come to the hood  
How they turn they nose up like they don't come from the hood  
Most of them be in sight til it's time to pitch  
That's when everything they write be a contradiction  
I tell em I do it for the love  
I do it for the hugs

With the ball in the gardens, stand tall, no dodgin'

2 Times for my niggas that be ducking the cops  
3 Times for my girls that pushing they own rides  
Stooshing they own rides from bitches they don't like

Then I'm on my own tonight  
I'll never know the answer.

It's in your lips and in your kiss  
It's in your touch and your fingertips  
And it's in all the things and other things  
That make you who you are and your eyes irresistible.

We're happy tonight  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away  
Is the bluebird  
Here to stay  
Is a new bird  
He sings a love song  
As we go along  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow  
We can build a snowman  
And pretend  
That he is Parson Brown  
He'll say are you married?  
We'll say No man  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town  
Later on, we'll conspire  
As we dream, by the fire  
To face unafraid  
The plans that we've made  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow  
We can build a snowman  
And pretend  
That he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun  
With Mr. Snowman  
Until the other kids  
Come knock him down  
  
When it's cold  
Ain't it thrilling  
When your nose  
Gets to chilling  
We'll frolic and play  
The eskimo way  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland

Just to see what it feels like.

Break some different hearts, finish what I start.  
I'm not gonna wait, to mess around with fate.
